Put your make-up on
Get your nails done
Curl your hair
Run the extra mile
Keep it slim so they like you
Do they like you?
Get your sexy on
Don't be shy, girl
Take it off
This is what you want, to belong, so they like you
Do you like you?

Get your shopping on, at the mall, max your credit cards
You don't have to choose, buy it all, so they like you
Do they like you?
Wait a second
Why, should you care, what they think of you?
When you're all alone, by yourself, do you like you?
Do you like you?

[Chorus 1]
You don't have to try so hard
You don't have to give it all away
You just have to get up, get up, get up, get up

Look into the mirror, at yourself
Don't you like you?
'Cause I like you"
3,Up To Something,Metro Boomin Featuring Travis Scott & Young Thug,"Pré-Coro
I always think about ''racks''
I think I am losing my mind
I'm not gonna settle for less
You don't see me wasting my fucking time
''Mo nengue'' vou te matar
Era isso que ele queria me ver a falar
But with me that shit doesn't fly
Eu vou continuar sempre a te ignorar

Coro
Hooo
This niggas up to something man
This niggas up to some (hmmm)
This niggas up to some (hmmmm ai ai)
Eu não consigo entender
Como que algumas pessoas são tão infelizes
Ao ponto de falar atoa
Fala bué mal mas à frente comigo está a rir
Eu não suporto esses ''mofuckers''
Mas eu nunca deixo de saudar, eu sou bem educado
Eu sou bem educado

Verso
Eu iria ficar triste mas tenho a minha família, mano eu tenho a minha Mama
Eu tenho a minha Sista, meu irmão, meus amigos, então vai ''pastar''
Eu estou ocupado à estudar para o bolso não ficar fininho
Rap anda tão seco, lhe chamo bolinho

Eu dou atenção à quem dá mas reciprocidade não se cobra, é um facto
Niggas se matam para comprar um telefone X, eu quero roupa no guarda fato
Eu sinto teu cheiro de longe mano, não subestima o meu olfato
Pego um, pego dois, quantos rappers forem, meto todos mesmo num prato

É que não me canso, é que sou chato
Flow afiado like a X-Acto
Não me comparo à ninguém, Rottweiler não vai competir com esses ratos
Mas eu não sou arrogante, não, não, não, não (2x)

Coro
Hooo
This niggas up to something man

4,Stay,Post Malone,"[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay"
5,Yeah Boy,Kelsea Ballerini,"[Verse 1]
Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

[Verse 2]
Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight

Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight

6,Blank Space,I Prevail,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

Hey, hey

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your... name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is he? Who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name...

[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"
7,Change Lanes,Kevin Gates,"[Intro]
Been through a lot of pain in my life
And I pray the Lord take it all away
W-W-W-W-Winner's Circle
I got family doing life, never see the sunshine again
And pray it all away
We all the way

[Chorus]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes

[Verse 1]
Making Salat, I ain't miss a beat
Praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' a massage
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
Out the mud, no one givin' us a start
White gold, iced out, Audemars
Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I’m bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that’s why they had to ship us

[Chorus]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes

[Verse 2]
(Vroom Vroom) This a Camaro
I'm rockin' Bread Winners' fitness apparel
Sexy receptionist look like a dancer
Pardon me ma'am, I'm demandin' some answers
Not makin' plans that was made to be cancelled
Coulda said, ""Hi,"" you know I'm kinda bashful
Unwillin' to fuck with me, why is you starin'?
Got some real niggas and we into sharin'
Conservative aura, I glow in the dark
I speak in no English, I'm talkin' numerics
Islamic fashion out in Paris, overseas when I travel, McLaren
Come to think this was me in the alley
Mickie D's we was purchasin' salads
Chi-raq, buyin' chicken from Harold's
Jerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage
Fresh yams, politic'n with family
I got status, gotta catch me in traffic
Makin' music, but I'm really a trapper
Booty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich
A hundred bands, if you ain't catch him, what's happenin'?
Maceo Haziz, told him we platinum
Amsterdam on the tram, we in transit
Word to God, I'ma fuck a Kardashian

[Chorus]
Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes"
8,Blame It On Me,Post Malone,"[Verse 1]
I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you (Breeze for you)
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Verse 2]
Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

[Chorus]
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

[Bridge]
It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed (Watchin' me bleed)
You cut me down on my knees (You cut me down on my knees)
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Outro]
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault"

'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element"

Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song

Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Post-Chorus: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are

Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Bridge: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris

[Outro: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better

Certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 08–1448. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011
Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held:  The Act does not comport with the First Amendment . Pp. 2–18.

(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And “the basic principles of freedom of speech … do not vary” with a new and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495 . The most basic principle—that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564 —is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test. See United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 , California’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence. And California’s claim that “interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2–11.

(b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 . California cannot meet that standard. Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos. The video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. Pp. 11–18.

556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.

Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C. J., joined. Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.
OPINION
Justice Scalia delivered the Opinion of the CourtWe consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First Amendment .
ICalifornia Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted” in a manner that “[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.

Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , No. C–05–04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).
IICalifornia correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. “Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man’s amusement, teaches another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York , 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948) . Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature … are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000) . And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, “the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment ’s command, do not vary” when a new and different medium for communication appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495, 503 (1952) .

The most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general matter, … government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the present,’ … the First Amendment has ‘permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’ and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992) ). These limited areas—such as obscenity, Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957) , incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam) , and fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U. S. 568 , 572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” id. , at 571–572.

Last Term, in Stevens , we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48 (amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California , 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973) , exempted depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,” §48(b). We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the depiction of animal cruelty—though States have long had laws against committing it.

The Government argued in Stevens that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a “simple balancing test” that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens , 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that “startling and dangerous” proposition. Ibid. “Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the “judgment [of] the American people,” embodied in the First Amendment , “that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 7).

That holding controls this case. 1 As in Stevens , California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller , supra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California , 403 U. S. 15, 20 (1971) ; Roth , supra, at 487, and n. 20.

Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State’s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In Winters , we considered a New York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,” 333 U. S., at 514. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity. “[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,” it said, “than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order. ” Id. , at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing that we rejected in Stevens . Our opinion in Winters , which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517–519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained “no indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Id. , at 519.

Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California’s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 (1968) . That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of sexual material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child. 2 We held that the legislature could “adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests …’ of … minors. ” Id. , at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York , 383 U. S. 502, 509 (1966) ). And because “obscenity is not protected expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature’s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children “was not irrational.” 390 U. S., at 641.

The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to adults —and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair’s breadth from the argument rejected in Stevens . Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.

That is unprecedented and mistaken. “[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville , 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, Ginsberg , supra , at 640–641; Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944) , but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed. “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik , supra, at 213–214. 3

California’s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to read—or read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage of gore. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers “till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.” The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198 (2006 ed.). Cinderella’s evil stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. Id. , at 95. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven. Id. , at 54.

High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer’s Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher & A. Lang transls. 1909) (“Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame”). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. Canto XXI, pp. 187–189 (A. Mandelbaum transl. Bantam Classic ed. 1982). And Golding’s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an island. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies 208–209 (1997 ed.). 4

This is not to say that minors’ consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the 1800’s, dime novels depicting crime and “penny dreadfuls” (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead. “The days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close… . They say that the moving picture machine … tends even more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison.” Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of movies because of their capacity to be “used for evil,” see Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio , 236 U. S. 230, 242 (1915) , but we eventually reversed course, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. , 343 U. S., at 502; see also Erznoznik , supra, at 212–214 (invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for Cato Institute, at 10–11. Many in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s blamed comic books for fostering a “preoccupation with violence and horror” among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 H arv . L. R ev . 489, 490 (1955). But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 11–15. 5 And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.

California claims that video games present special problems because they are “interactive,” in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957–958 (CA8 2003). As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.” American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick , 244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).

Justice Alito has done considerable independent re-search to identify, see post , at 14–15, nn. 13–18, video games in which “the violence is astounding,” post , at 14. “Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.” Ibid. Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito ’s description, post , at 14–15, of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence—“ ‘ethnic cleansing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.” To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the “aggressiveness” that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s ire, and the reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito ’s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.
IIIBecause the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. , 505 U. S., at 395. The State must specifically identify an “actual problem” in need of solving, Playboy , 529 U. S., at 822–823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see R. A. V. , supra, at 395. That is a demanding standard. “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.” Playboy , supra, at 818.

California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 (1994) , the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on Turner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied intermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id. , at 661–662. California’s burden is much higher, and because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy , supra, at 816–817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.

The State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, 6 and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, “[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.” Video Software Dealers Assn. 556 F. 3d, at 964. They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children’s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game. 7

Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson’s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children’s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the “effect sizes” of children’s exposure to violent video games are “about the same” as that produced by their exposure to violence on television. App. 1263. And he admits that the same effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, id., at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated “E” (appropriate for all ages), id., at 1270, or even when they “vie[w] a picture of a gun,” id., at 1315–1316. 8

Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994) ; Florida Star v. B. J. F. , 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989) . Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment—at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers—and has given no persuasive reason why.

The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it’s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child’s or putative parent’s, aunt’s, or uncle’s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.

California claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties for conveying protected speech to children just in case their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that “only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].” Erznoznik , 422 U. S., at 212–213.

But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell “M” rated games to minors only with parental consent. Id., at 47. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, “the video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries” in “(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re-stricting children’s access to mature-rated products at retail.” FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http:// www.ftc.gov / os/ 2009 / 12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents’ control can hardly be a compelling state interest. 9

And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assisting parents” that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.

*  *  *

California’s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a “well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky , 315 U. S., at 571–572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.

California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 546 (1993) . As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.

We affirm the judgment below.

It is so ordered.
Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.The California statute that is before us in this case represents a pioneering effort to address what the state legislature and others regard as a potentially serious social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video games on impressionable minors, who often spend countless hours immersed in the alternative worlds that these games create. Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.

I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court's opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.

In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games—federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents—are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem. See ante, at 2737-2739, 2740-2741. Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down scores of innocent victims is not different in ""kind"" from reading a description of violence in a work of literature. See ante, at 2737-2738.

The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.
IRespondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the narrower ground that the law's definition of ""violent video game,"" see Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009), is impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23-61. Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.[1]
ADue process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The lack of such notice in a law that regulates expression ""raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech."" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Vague laws force potential speakers to ""`steer far wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked."" Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). While ""perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity,"" Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), ""government may regulate in the area"" of First Amendment freedoms ""only with narrow specificity,"" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); see also Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). These principles apply to laws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting children. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968).

Here, the California law does not define ""violent video games"" with the ""narrow specificity"" that the Constitution demands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment problems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)—a law that prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to minors, see id., at 631-633, 88 S.Ct. 1274. But the California Legislature departed from the Ginsberg model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.
BThe law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed ""harmful to minors,"" and the law defined ""harmful to minors"" simply by adding the words ""for minors"" to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court's leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), and Book Named ""John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966).

Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.

Under Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh-old limitation that restricts the statute's scope to specifically described ""hard core"" materials. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Materials that fall within this ""hard core"" category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:

(1) an ""average person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest"";

(2) ""the work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and""

(3) ""the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."" Id., at 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Adapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: ""[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being."" § 1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law's restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:
(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.

""(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.

""(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A).[2]CThe first important difference between the Ginsberg law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the Ginsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in Miller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute's coverage to specifically defined ""hard core"" depictions. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only ""[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,"" ""masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals."" Id., at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function. ""We are satisfied,"" the Court wrote, ""that these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution."" Id., at 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607; see also Reno, supra, at 873, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (observing that Miller's threshold limitation ""reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term `patently offensive'"").[3]

By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided, depictions of ""hard core"" sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law. It provides that a video game cannot qualify as ""violent"" unless ""the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being."" § 1746(d)(1).

For better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming[4] as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors. The California law's threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in Miller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.

Because of this feature of the California law's threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.

One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to ""prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element points in the same direction, asking whether ""[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,"" would find that it ""appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors."" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).

The terms ""deviant"" and ""morbid"" are not defined in the statute, and California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that ""[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through . . . a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms""). I therefore assume that ""deviant"" and ""morbid"" carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech. The adjective ""deviant"" ordinarily means ""deviating . . . from some accepted norm,"" and the term ""morbid"" means ""of, relating to, or characteristic of disease."" Webster's 618, 1469. A ""deviant or morbid interest"" in violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that deviates from what is regarded—presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard—as normal and healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.

The California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is enough to qualify the game as ""violent."" And because the Miller test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game  law would not present vagueness problems.

There is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment. By the time of this Court's landmark obscenity cases in the 1960's, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth, 354 U.S., at 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.

There is no similar history regarding expression related to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children's stories sometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 2736-2737.

Although our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children's literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite ""deviant"" or ""morbid"" impulses. See Edwards & Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because ""there is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence"").

Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature's decision to lump all minors together. The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.

In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law's references to ""minors"" would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors—that is, those just short of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. However, ""it is not within our power to construe and narrow state laws."" Grayned, 408 U.S., at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294. We can only ""`extrapolate [their] allowable meaning'"" from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State. Ibid. (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 174, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).

In this case, California has not provided any evidence that the California Legislature intended the law to be limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts that would support an ""oldest minors"" construction.[5]

For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny. We should address that question only if and when it is necessary to do so.
IIHaving outlined how I would decide this case, I will now briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wisdom of the Court's approach. Some of these reasons are touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared at this time to go as far as either Justice THOMAS or Justice BREYER, they raise valid concerns.
AThe Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010), ""controls this case."" Ante, at 2734. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults. And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.

Second, Stevens does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The portion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the Government's contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of any First Amendment protection. 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1582. Going well beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, our most closely related precedent. As a result of today's decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what Ginsberg described as ""girlie magazines,"" but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.

Third, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment. See 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592. In this case, the Court's sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors' access to violent video games is allowed—at least without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.
BThe Court's opinion distorts the effect of the California law. I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no ""free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,"" ante, at 2736, but the California law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in Ginsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.

Citing the video-game industry's voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not ""meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children's access to violent video games but cannot do so."" Ante, at 2740. The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 7-10, a threat that the Court's opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired[6]— or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does the Court note, as Justice BREYER points out, see post, at 2767 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children's use of computers and gaming devices.
CFinally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before. Any assessment of the experience of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.

Today's most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end. These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.[7] Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,[8] and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.[9] It is also forecast that video games will soon provide sensory feedback.[10] By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character  on the screen.[11] Some amici who support respondents foresee the day when ""`virtual-reality shoot-`em-ups'"" will allow children to ""`actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head'"" of a victim. Brief for Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).

Persons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create. Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people. A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game. In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world. While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character in the game to perform.[12] For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat—either to hit a ball or smash a skull—could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.

These present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.

In some of these games, the violence is astounding.[13] Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg for mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools. Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown. In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.

It also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit. There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.[14] The objective of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;[15] in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.[16] There is a game in which players engage in ""ethnic cleansing"" and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.[17] In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.[18]

If the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the characteristics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.

The Court is untroubled by this possibility. According to the Court, the ""interactive"" nature of video games is ""nothing new"" because ""all literature is interactive."" Ante, at 2738. Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)—a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents— tells us that video games are ""far more concretely interactive."" Brief for IGDA et al. as Amici Curiae 3. And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.

It is certainly true, as the Court notes, that ""`[l]iterature, when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader's own.'"" Ante, at 2738 (quoting American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572, 577 (C.A.7 2001)). But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game. To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolnikov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed.1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands. For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.[19]

When all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so, then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.

For all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires. I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem. If differently framed statutes are enacted by the States or by the Federal Government, we can consider the constitutionality of those laws when cases challenging them are presented to us.
Justice THOMAS, dissenting.The Court's decision today does not comport with the original public understanding of the First Amendment. The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain video games to minors because the law ""abridg[es] the freedom of speech."" U.S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that ""the freedom of speech,"" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.[1]
IWhen interpreting a constitutional provision, ""the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that] provision at the time it was adopted."" McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3072, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution is a written instrument, ""its meaning does not alter."" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 359, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""That which it meant when adopted, it means now."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

As originally understood, the First Amendment's protection against laws ""abridging the freedom of speech"" did not extend to all speech. ""There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem."" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S.  ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1582-1583, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). Laws regulating such speech do not ""abridg[e] the freedom of speech"" because such speech is understood to fall outside ""the freedom of speech."" See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 245-246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).

In my view, the ""practices and beliefs held by the Founders"" reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra, at 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511. The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include a right to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as Amicus Curiae 12-15. The founding generation would not have considered it an abridgment of ""the freedom of speech"" to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors' parents.
AAttitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights. A complete understanding of the founding generation's views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.

In the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority. ""The patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society."" S. Mintz, Huck's Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz 13.

Part of the father's absolute power was the right and duty ""to fill his children's minds with knowledge and . . . make them apply their knowledge in right action."" E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed.1966) (herein-after Morgan). Puritans thought children were ""innately sinful and that parents' primary task was to suppress their children's natural depravity."" S. Mintz & S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz & Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (""Children should not be left to themselves . . . to do as they please;. . . not being fit to govern themselves""); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read ""vain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs"" or ""fond and amorous Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like."" The History of Genesis, pp. vi-vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).

This conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents' consent. 2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275 (1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a ""stubborn or rebellious son"" of 16 years or more committed a capital offense if he disobeyed ""the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother."" The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed.1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600's).
BIn the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775-1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But the same overarching principles remained. Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children. They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read. And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.
1The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood. See Reinier 2-5; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in the House 59-60 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert). Locke taught that children's minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed. Parents had only themselves to blame if, ""by humouring and cockering"" their children, they ""poison'd the fountain"" and later ""taste[d] the bitter waters."" Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27-28 (C. Eliot ed.1910). All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and ""those about children."" Id., at 29. Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it. Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child's development. Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by ""a tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence."" J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.

These writings received considerable attention in America. Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg & May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau's Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract. Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz & Kellogg 45.
2Locke's and Rousseau's writings fostered a new conception of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg). Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that ""[t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals."" On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed.1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster's First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: ""The Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression."" M. Norton, Liberty's Daughters 101 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (""[I]n early youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression""); J. Abbott, The Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (""What impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the susceptibility of youth"").

Children lacked reason and decisionmaking ability. They ""have not Judgment or Will of their own,"" John Adams noted. Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed.1979); see also Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton ed.1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that children do not vote because they ""want prudence"" and ""have no will of their own""). Children's ""utter incapacity"" rendered them ""almost wholly at the mercy of their Parents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life."" J. Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).

This conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children. ""Youth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits."" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (""The vices of young people are generally learned from each other""); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (""[C]hildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable""). Books therefore advised parents ""not to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust."" L. Child, The Mother's Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149-150 (1988) (noting that it was ""considered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices"").

As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development. See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24-25, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young mind was considered ""infinitely important."" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72-73 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as ""a rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds."" Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from ""every low-bred, drunken, immoral character"" and keeping their minds ""untainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root."" Id., at 63; see also Rush, in id., at 16 (""[T]he most useful citizens have  been formed from those youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age""); Burgh 7 (""[T]he souls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor"").

The Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Republic would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv-xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (""[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us""). Children were ""the pivot of the moral world,"" and their proper development was ""a subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called."" Id., at xvi.
3Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children's growth. Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58-59; MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible for instilling ""moral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare a child for the outside world."" Mintz & Kellogg 58; see also Youth's Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth's Companion) (""Let [children's] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day""). In short, ""[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation."" MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 (N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).

This conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's approach to raising children. He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do. See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in id., at 45-46 (""I do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life . . . . [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on""). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write ""by every post"" and instructed her, ""Inform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn."" Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr's father died. See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405-408 (J. Boyd ed.1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing ""in what manner you employ every hour in the day""); see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).

Jefferson's rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon. ""[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and stressing continued subjection to the parental will."" Norton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830's gave prototypical advice. In The Mother's Book, Lydia Child advised that ""[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always must be done."" Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that ""[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government."" Abbott 18. Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child's ""foolish and unreasonable wishes"" would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.

The concept of total parental control over children's lives extended into the schools. ""The government both of families and schools should be absolute,"" declared Noah Webster. Rudolph 57-58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: ""In the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as absolute as possible."" Id., at 16. Through the doctrine of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the ""`sacred dut[y] of parents . . . to train up and qualify their children'"" and exercised the same authority ""`to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.'"" Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 413-414, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pendergrass, 19 N.C. 365, 365-366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73. Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to ""be watched with the most scrupulous attention."" Webster, in Rudolph 64.

For their part, children were expected to be dutiful and obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience. See Adams, ""Pictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame"": The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191 (1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.

An entire genre of books, ""loosely termed `advice to youth,'"" taught similar lessons well into the 1800's. J. Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. ""Next to your duty to God,"" advised one book, ""is your duty to your parents"" even if the child did not ""understand the reason of their commands."" L. Sigourney, The Girl's Reading Book 44 (14th ed. 1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent's Present 44 (3d ed. 1841). ""Disobedience is generally punished in some way or other,"" warned another, ""and often very severely."" S. Goodrich, Peter Parley's Book of Fables 43 (1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848) (""[T]he number of children who die from the effects of disobedience to their parents is very large"").
4Society's concern with children's development extended to the books they read. ""Vice always spreads by being published,"" Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. ""[Y]oung people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known had they never read such books or attended such public places."" Ibid.; see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning parents that ""[t]he first reading lessons for children have an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of future years""); Youth's Companion 1 (""[T]he capacities of children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth, require select and appropriate reading""). Prominent children's authors harshly criticized  fairy tales and the use of anthropomorphic animals. See, e.g., S. Goodrich, 2 Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy tales as ""calculated to familiarize the mind with things shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and debauched fancy""); 1 id., at 167 (recalling that children's books were ""full of nonsense"" and ""lies""); Cardell, p. xiv (""The fancy of converting inferior animals into `teachers of children,' has been carried to ridiculous extravagance""); see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700's).

Adults carefully controlled what they published for children. Stories written for children were dedicated to moral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking details that might titillate children's minds. See MacLeod 24-25, 42-48; see also id., at 42 (""The authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more exciting fare""); Francis, American Children's Literature, 1646-1880, in American Childhood 208-209 (J. Hawes & N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children's literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished. Reinier 12.

Parents had total authority over what their children read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994) (""Ideally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century parents regulated their children's lives fully, certainly including their reading""). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The Mother's Book: ""Children . . . should not read anything without a mother's knowledge and sanction; this is particularly necessary between the ages of twelve and sixteen."" Child 92; see also id., at 143 (""[P]arents, or some guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume they put into the hands of young people""); E. Monaghan, Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America 337 (2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl's journal from the early 1770's and noting that the child's aunts monitored and guided her reading).
5The law at the time reflected the founding generation's understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and education their children, and therefore had ""power"" over their children. 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 712, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (Blackstone's Commentaries was ""a primary legal authority for 18th- and 19th-century American lawyers""). Chancellor James Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189-*207. The law entitled parents to ""the custody of their [children],"" ""the value of th[e] [children's] labor and services,"" and the ""right to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust."" Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with ""obedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives."" Id., at *207.

Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child's labor and services until the child reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, ""There is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself."" Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C.J.) (""The law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings""). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, ""cannot be contested."" Gale v. Parrot, 1 N.H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276, 1809 WL 295 (S.C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 14 Ky. 25, 4 Litt. 25 (1823).

Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent. Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21-24. And after the war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents' request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa.1814) (per curiam).

Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82-83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed.1981). In general, ""[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its significance."" Grossberg 105.

Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason. Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could they swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.
CThe history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children. The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty. See MacDonald 6 (""The Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today""). In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child's mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before. See Mintz 72 (""By weakening  earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability""). Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children's reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.
IIAIn light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include an unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents. As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor—""abridg[e] the freedom of speech"" within the original meaning of the First Amendment.

We have recently noted that this Court does not have ""freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment."" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1586. But we also recognized that there may be ""some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law."" Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.[2]
BAdmittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provision does not always comport with modern sensibilities. See Morse, 551 U.S., at 419, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students ""as though it were still the 19th century would find little support today""). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See McDonald, 561 U.S., at ___-___, 130 S.Ct., at 3084-3086 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).

This, however, is not such a case. Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today. For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor's parent. See, e.g., Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.  § 787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 558, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (Appendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent. 10 U.S.C. § 505(a). And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, id., at 15.

Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not. State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty. See Roper, supra, at 581-585, 125 S.Ct. 1183 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh.Code Ann. §§ 12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, § 326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate Code Ann. § 6220 (West 2009).

My understanding of ""the freedom of speech"" is also consistent with this Court's precedents. To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see id., at 213-214, 95 S.Ct. 2268; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). But this Court has never held, until today, that ""the freedom of speech"" includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. To the contrary, ""[i]t is well settled that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than on those available to adults."" Erznoznik, supra, at 212, 95 S.Ct. 2268; cf. post, at 2762-2763 (BREYER, J., dissenting).

The Court's constitutional jurisprudence ""historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children."" Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). Under that case law, ""legislature[s][can] properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . primary responsibility for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility."" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 635, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (opinion of Powell, J.) (""[T]he State is entitled to adjust its legal system to account for children's vulnerability and their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and. . . paternal attention"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is because ""the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter."" Id., at 638, 99 S.Ct. 3035; id., at 638-639, 99 S.Ct. 3035 (""Legal restrictions on minors, especially those supportive of the parental role, may be important to the child's chances for the full growth and maturity that make eventual participation in a free society meaningful and rewarding"").
IIIThe California law at issue here prohibits the sale or rental of ""violent video game[s]"" to minors, defined as anyone ""under 18 years of age."" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. §§ 1746.1(a), 1746 (West 2009). A violation of the law is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. § 1746.3. Critically, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors from playing such games. Cf. ante, at 2747 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2766-2767 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The law also does not restrict a ""minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian"" from selling or renting him a violent video game. § 1746.1(c).

Respondents, associations of companies in the video game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to California's law, claiming that on its face the law violates the free speech rights of their members. The Court holds that video games are speech for purposes of the First Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitutional. See ante, at 2742-2743, 2747-2751. I disagree.

Under any of this Court's standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game associations cannot show ""that no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,"" ""that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,"" or that ""a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent's or guardian's help. In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor's parent or guardian. Because such speech does not fall within ""the freedom of speech"" as originally understood, California's law does not ordinarily implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.[3]

* * *

""The freedom of speech,"" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors' parents or guardians. Therefore, I cannot agree that the statute at issue is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

I respectfully dissent.
Justice BREYER, dissenting.California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any person who distributes a violent video game in California without labeling it ""18,"" or who sells or rents a labeled violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Applying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would consequently reject the industries' facial challenge.
IACalifornia's statute defines a violent video game as: A game in which a player ""kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,""

and
[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,""and
[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,""and
the game, as a whole, ... lack[s] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors."" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1) (West 2009).The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it requires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§ 1746.1-1746.3.
BA facial challenge to this statute based on the First Amendment can succeed only if ""a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1587, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry's own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act's criteria. That area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).
CIn determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court's ""vagueness"" precedents and a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of ""depictions of violence,"" ante, at 2736, but rather the category of ""protection of children."" This Court has held that the ""power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults."" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). And the ""`regulatio[n] of communication addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.'"" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638, n. 6, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (quoting Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L.J. 877, 939 (1963)).

The majority's claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a ""new categor[y] of unprotected speech,"" ante, at 2734, 2735, is overstated. No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, automatically fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and  depictions of child pornography. We properly speak of categories of expression that lack protection when, like ""child pornography,"" the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of ""fire"" in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a ""new category of unprotected speech."" See Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010).

Thus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.
IIIn my view, California's statute provides ""fair notice of what is prohibited,"" and consequently it is not impermissibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of a
picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity ...,""that
predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,""and
is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,""and
is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors."" 390 U.S., at 646-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274.This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg (which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U.S., at 643-645, 88 S.Ct. 1274. No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648-650, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650-671, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671-675, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Fortas, J., dissenting).

Comparing the language of California's statute (set forth supra, at 2732-2733) with the language of New York's statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words ""kill,"" ""maim,"" and ""dismember"" any more difficult to understand than the word ""nudity?"" Justice ALITO objects that these words do ""not perform the narrowing function"" that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes can only cover ""`hard core'"" depictions. Ante, at 2744-2745 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to Ginsberg, which dealt with ""nudity,"" a category no more ""narrow"" than killing and maiming. And in any event, narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have anything to do with one another. All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms ""kill,"" ""maim,"" and ""dismember"" give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.

The remainder of California's definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), in permitting a total ban on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal penalties). The California law's reliance on ""community standards"" adheres to Miller, and in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 916, 103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989), this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller' s language against charges of vagueness. California only departed from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It substituted the word ""deviant"" for the words ""prurient"" and ""shameful,"" and it three times added the words ""for minors."" The word ""deviant"" differs from ""prurient"" and ""shameful,"" but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition of ""for minors"" to a version of the Miller standard was approved in Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 643, 88 S.Ct. 1274, even though the New York law ""dr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,"" ante, at 2746 (opinion of ALITO, J.).

Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court's long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, ""I know it when I see it."" Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller's standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U.S., at 39-40, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the ""community standards"" tests used in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830 (the Constitution does not always require ""`perfect clarity and precise guidance,'"" even when ""`expressive activity'"" is involved).

What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and Miller on the one hand and the California law on the other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California's statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer's knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.) See also ante, at 2749-2750 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law clearly protects even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. § 1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute's border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who ""typically have experience with children"" assess what games are inappropriate for minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http:// www.esrb.org/ratings/ & ratings_ process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg statute concerned depictions of ""nudity,"" while California's statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? Justice ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because there are ""certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex,"" whereas there are no similarly ""accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment."" Ante, at 2745. But there is no evidence that is so. The Court relied on ""community standards"" in Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating ""accepted norms"" about depictions of sex. I can find no difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the vagueness question. Indeed, the majority's examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice ALITO relies, do not show anything relevant at all.

After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence. Indeed, sex ""has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages."" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). For every Homer, there is a Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.

Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related differences between California's law and the New York law upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (""[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts""). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at 644, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1088-1089, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.
IIIVideo games combine physical action with expression. Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game involving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children. See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (""Title I— Children's Product Safety""). But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State's power to regulate. And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.

Like the majority, I believe that the California law must be ""narrowly tailored"" to further a ""compelling interest,"" without there being a ""less restrictive"" alternative that would be ""at least as effective."" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 875, 879, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). I would not apply this strict standard ""mechanically."" United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 841, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially-justifying ""compelling interests,"" the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, ""the statute works speech-related harm ... out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide."" Ibid. See also Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a ""significant impingement"" on speech).

First Amendment standards applied in this way are difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying ""strict scrutiny"" the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2723-3730; but cf. id., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2731 (BREYER, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at 210-211, 112 S.Ct. 1846 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 177 L.Ed.2d 493 (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were ""`closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest,'"" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 387-388, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000).

Moreover, although the Court did not specify the ""level of scrutiny"" it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently described that case as finding a ""compelling interest"" in protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limitations on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Since the Court in Ginsberg specified that the statute's prohibition applied to material that was not obscene, 390 U.S., at 634, 88 S.Ct. 1274, I cannot dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscenity. But cf. ante, at 2735 (majority opinion). Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted only that the legislature have a ""rational"" basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390 U.S., at 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274. For in this case, California has substantiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger evidence.
ACalifornia's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help. § 1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent's assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17. See Brief for Respondents 8.

Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or videos, or books. A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 2748-2749 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie. See infra, at 2768-2769.
BThe interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling. As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the ""basic"" parental claim ""to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,"" which makes it proper to enact ""laws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,"" and (2) the State's ""independent interest in the well-being of its youth."" Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 639-640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (""`[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit'"" (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum. L.Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally ""underinclusive"" for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.

Both interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968 that ""`parental control or guidance cannot always be provided.'"" 390 U.S., at 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who's Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents' authority to guide their children's development.

As to the State's independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a ""`lack of maturity'"" and are ""more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,"" and that their ""character ... is not as well formed as that of an adult."" Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). And we have therefore recognized ""a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors."" Sable Communications, supra, at 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829.

At the same time, there is considerable evidence that California's statute significantly furthers this compelling interest. That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well. Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and reward the player for performing that task well. Why else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Training Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at http://articles.cnn.com / 2001-11-2 / tech /2war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.

When the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose. But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.

There are many scientific studies that support California's views. Social scientists, for example, have found causal evidence that playing these games results in harm. Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period. See Möller & Krahe, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile & Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J. Youth & Adolescence 127 (2008); Anderson et al., Longitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the United States, 122 Pediatrics e1067 (2008); Wallenius & Punamuki, Digital Game Violence and Direct Aggression in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Sex, Age, and Parent-Child Communication, 29 J. Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).

Experimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games. See, e.g., Anderson et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).

Surveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression. See, e.g., Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).

Cutting-edge neuroscience has shown that ""virtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior."" Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).

And ""meta-analyses,"" i.e., studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games ""was positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,"" and that ""playing violent video games is a causal risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes."" Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bulletin 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).

Some of these studies take care to explain in a commonsense way why video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they say that the closer a child's behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm. See Bushman & Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed.2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because ""[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,"" players are ""more likely to identify with violent characters,"" and ""violent games directly reward violent behavior""); Polman, de Castro, & van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children's Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, & K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136-137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television). See also infra, at 2769-2770 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than ""passive"" media like television); ante, at 2748-2751 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).

Experts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right. But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.

Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:
[O]ver 1000 studies ... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children ... [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people ... may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music."" Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:
[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure ... increases aggressive behavior, ... increases aggressive thoughts, ... increases angry feelings,... decreases helpful behavior, and ... increases physiological arousal."" Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at http://ww.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/interactive-media.pdf.The Association added:
[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films."" Ibid. (emphasis added).Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media. It said:
Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even more profound than those of passive media such as television. In many games the child or teenager is `embedded' in the game and uses a `joystick' (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings."" Policy Statement—Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).It added:
Correlational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed similar effects across 2 years."" Ibid. (footnotes omitted).Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature's conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children. This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2726-2727 (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government's national security judgments); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195-196, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government's technological judgments). The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all. Compare ante, at 2738-2739 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games ""cause"" harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 2767-2768 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).
CI can find no ""less restrictive"" alternative to California's law that would be ""at least as effective."" See Reno, 521 U.S., at 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329. The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an ""M"" (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 2740-2741. But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps. When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www. ftc.gov/os/2004/ 07/040708kidsviolencerpt. pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of the FTC's most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today's broad ruling reduces the industry's incentive to police itself.


IVThe upshot is that California's statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents' efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California's statute is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.

I add that the majority's different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also topless?

This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California's law is constitutional on its face.

This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made for children—by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here—a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.

For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.
FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to us ill founded. He suggests, post, at 2747 (opinion concurring in judgment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 2746-2747, 2747, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the ""creation"" or ""possession"" of violent depictions. That distinction appears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books—though not the writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally, Justice ALITO points out, post, at 2747, that Stevens ""left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute"" would be constitutional. True, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592, that the ""crush-video"" statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are criminally liable.

[2] The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of ""nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,"" that were ""`[h]armful to minors.'"" A depiction was harmful to minors if it:

""(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interests of minors, and

""(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and

""(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors."" 390 U.S., at 646, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law § 484-h(1)(f)).

[3] Justice THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to without their parents' consent. He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to enforce parental prohibitions—to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or saying anything without their parents' prior consent. The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents' prior written consent—even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors. And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents' prior consent. Our point is not, as Justice THOMAS believes, post, at 2759, n. 2, merely that such laws are ""undesirable."" They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children's speech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only to a parental veto. In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child's speech and religion (Justice THOMAS cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional. This argument is not, as Justice THOMAS asserts, ""circular,"" ibid. It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our ipse dixit, that renders them invalid.

[4] Justice ALITO accuses us of pronouncing that playing violent video games ""is not different in `kind'"" from reading violent literature. Post, at 2742. Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection. Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny—a question to which we devote our attention in Part III, infra. Even if we can see in them ""nothing of any possible value to society . . ., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."" Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948).

[5] The crusade against comic books was led by a psychiatrist, Frederic Wertham, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that ""as long as the crime comic books industry exists in its present forms there are no secure homes."" Juvenile Delinquency (Comic Books): Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 84 (1954). Wertham's objections extended even to Superman comics, which he described as ""particularly injurious to the ethical development of children."" Id., at 86. Wertham's crusade did convince the New York Legislature to pass a ban on the sale of certain comic books to minors, but it was vetoed by Governor Thomas Dewey on the ground that it was unconstitutional given our opinion in Winters, supra. See People v. Bookcase, Inc., 14 N.Y.2d 409, 412-413, 252 N.Y.S.2d 433, 201 N.E.2d 14, 15-16 (1964).

Granholm, 426 F.Supp.2d 646, 653 (E.D.Mich. 2006); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Blagojevich, 404 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1063 (N.D.Ill. 2005), aff'd, 469 F.3d 641 (C.A.7 2006).

[7] One study, for example, found that children who had just finished playing violent video games were more likely to fill in the blank letter in ""explo_e"" with a ""d"" (so that it reads ""explode"") than with an ""r"" (""explore""). App. 496, 506 (internal quotation marks omitted). The prevention of this phenomenon, which might have been anticipated with common sense, is not a compelling state interest.

[8] Justice ALITO is mistaken in thinking that we fail to take account of ""new and rapidly evolving technology,"" post, at 2742. The studies in question pertain to that new and rapidly evolving technology, and fail to show, with the degree of certitude that strict scrutiny requires, that this subject-matter restriction on speech is justified. Nor is Justice ALITO correct in attributing to us the view that ""violent video games really present no serious problem."" Post, at 2742. Perhaps they do present a problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play them. But there are all sorts of ""problems""—some of them surely more serious than this one— that cannot be addressed by governmental restriction of free expression: for example, the problem of encouraging anti-Semitism (National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam)), the problem of spreading a political philosophy hostile to the Constitution (Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 81 S.Ct. 1517, 6 L.Ed.2d 836 (1961)), or the problem of encouraging disrespect for the Nation's flag (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989)).

Justice BREYER would hold that California has satisfied strict scrutiny based upon his own research into the issue of the harmfulness of violent video games. See post, at 2771-2779 (Appendixes to dissenting opinion) (listing competing academic articles discussing the harmfulness vel non of violent video games). The vast preponderance of this research is outside the record—and in any event we do not see how it could lead to Justice BREYER's conclusion, since he admits he cannot say whether the studies on his side are right or wrong. Post, at 2769. Similarly, Justice ALITO says he is not ""sure"" whether there are any constitutionally dispositive differences between video games and other media. Post, at 2742-2743. If that is so, then strict scrutiny plainly has not been satisfied.

[9] Justice BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling because, according to the FTC's report, some ""20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated games."" Post, at 2770 (citing FTC Report 28). But some gap in compliance is unavoidable. The sale of alcohol to minors, for example, has long been illegal, but a 2005 study suggests that about 18% of retailers still sell alcohol to those under the drinking age. Brief for State of Rhode Island et al. as Amici Curiae 18. Even if the sale of violent video games to minors could be deterred further by increasing regulation, the government does not have a compelling interest in each marginal percentage point by which its goals are advanced.
ALITO CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1] It is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower court. Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478, n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979).

[2] Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold requirement set out in text also qualifies as ""violent"" if it ""[e]nables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim."" § 1746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is unconstitutional, 556 F.3d 950, 954, n. 5 (C.A.9 2009), and therefore only the requirements set out in text are now before us.

[3] The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was convicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision applied to depictions of ""nudity"" and ""sexual conduct,"" and both those terms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U.S., at 645-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).

[4] The California law does not define the term ""maiming,"" nor has the State cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this context. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning, which includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster's).

[5] At oral argument, California also proposed that the term ""minors"" could be interpreted as referring to the ""typical age group of minors"" who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law's text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.

[19] As the Court notes, there are a few children's books that ask young readers to step into the shoes of a character and to make choices that take the stories along one of a very limited number of possible lines. See ante, at 2737-2738. But the very nature of the print medium makes it impossible for a book to offer anything like the same number of choices as those provided by a video game.
THOMAS DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO concludes that the law is too vague to satisfy due process, but neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed that question. Ante, at 2742-2747 (opinion concurring in judgment). As we have often said, this Court is ""one of final review, `not of first view.'"" FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 1819, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005)).

[2] The majority responds that ""it does not follow"" from the historical evidence ""that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing . . . anything without their parents' prior consent."" Ante, at 2736, n. 3. Such a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its view, would be undesirable and ""obviously"" unconstitutional. Ibid.

The majority's circular argument misses the point. The question is not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators today, but rather what the public likely understood ""the freedom of speech"" to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634-635, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). I believe it is clear that the founding public would not have understood ""the freedom of speech"" to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents. It follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state regulation of such speech. To note that there may not be ""precedent for [such] state control,"" ante, at 2736, n. 3, ""is not to establish that [there] is a constitutional right,"" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 373, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

[3] Whether the statute would survive an as-applied challenge in the unusual case of an emancipated minor is a question for another day. To decide this case, it is enough that the statute is not unconstitutional on its face."

I've been rollin' on the freeway

All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down

I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

31,Pray,Sam Smith Featuring Logic,"[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and—
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
""Can you hear me?""
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge: Sam Smith]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray"

'Bout the time we spent, girl, when we were just friends
It was all friendly on my end
Even though I look forward to seeing you again like, uh
When am I seeing you again?
Ayy, when are we speaking again?
Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin
Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah
No, he don't like it, call me up, he don't like it
This was the perfect timing
Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah
Talk about you like a queen makin' him madder
As if he never even mattered
And you a bad bitch, you keep getting badder
This ain't the side nigga anthem
I've been straight forward, he's going backwards

[Interlude]
Relax, yo, just chill
I love you, I’m with you
I ain’t with this nigga
You don’t think I…
He’s my best friend, he’s my brother
That’s my brother!
He ain’t your brother
That your blood?
You got the same momma and daddy?
Aight babe
You fuckin that nigga, that’s what it is
I’m fucking my brother? That’s my brother…
No, no, if y'all ain’t got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck
You fuckin’ him

[Verse 2]
You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

[Outro]
That's all
That's all I want, all I want, all I want
That's all I want, all I want, yeah
All I want (just a, just a little time)"

When tomorrow comes, I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes

I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, lost hope that I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along

Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 2]
I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 3]
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel"

I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion

The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

Of every little thing

I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up

When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

All that living fast, pour the lean, make me slower
You know I ain't that nigga to be played, do your homework
If I could do it all over, I'd make the same mistakes
All that fucking over made me who I am today
Slidin' Maybach with the drapes, you can't see me pass
I was in the school on a C class
I tried the Perky but it ain't work, and I'ma still pop 'em

To a nigga with no hope, hung himself by a rope (Straight up)

And he served an undercover, judge gave his ass a boat (Facts)
I done seen fame turn a nigga on his bro
Turn a bitch into a nigga, nigga turned into a ho (21)
Identity crisis, people don't know who they is
'Cause these bitches act like niggas
And these niggas act like hoes (Straight up)
Shooting for the moon but the stars just fine (21)

(Till forever, till forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster real in me
That always wants to kill emcees
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah

[Chorus]
So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

Your soul is pure golden
Must’ve been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few

It’s been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn’t make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?

I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness

Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone

Heavy is the crown only for the weak

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down

I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)

I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now (Nothing hurts me now)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
Now watch me burn it down

Breathe, feel the air that I breathe (Yeah)
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah

(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""Hey, baby!""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]

(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!

Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!"

[Verso 1: Halsey]
Ella ya no me besa más en la boca
Porque es mas intimo, de lo que ella cree que deberíamos tener
Ella ya no me mira más a los ojos
Está demasiado asustada de lo qué verá; alguien abrazándome

[Pre-Coro: Halsey]
Cuando despierto completamente sola
Y pienso en tu piel
Yo recuerdo, recuerdo lo que me dijiste

[Coro 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Dijiste que no somos amantes, sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto
No somos amantes, sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto

[Verso 2: Lauren Jauregui]
Ella ya no me llama más por teléfono
Ella nunca está escuchando, dice que es inocente
Ella ya no me deja tener el control
Debo haber cruzado la línea, debo haber perdido la cabeza

[Pre-Coro: Halsey]
Cuando despierto completamente sola
Y pienso en tu piel
Yo recuerdo, recuerdo lo que me dijiste

[Coro 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Dijiste que no somos amantes, sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto
No somos amantes, sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto

[Puente: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & ambas]
Extraño las mañanas contigo acostada en mi cama
Extraño los recuerdos que se repiten en mi cabeza
Extraño la idea de una eternidad, tú y yo
Pero todo lo que tú extrañas es mi cuerpo, oh

[Coro 2: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & ambas]
Dijiste que no somos amantes (no somos amantes)
Porque sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto
No somos amantes, sólo somos extrañas
Con la misma maldita hambre
De ser tocadas, de ser amadas, de no sentir nada en absoluto (nada)

Don't get me wrong, it's pretty cool to be on TV
So all the folks back home can see me
And that I'm livin' it out
All the things I used to dream about
Yeah, it's pretty great, singin' on a stage
Proud 'cause there ain't an empty seat in the place
But, girl, ever since I met you
I got a whole new perspective

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl

If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I hope the first question people ask me
Is ""How's your girl and how's your family?""
I could go on and on and on

You can bet when I hear, ""Congratulations""
Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here

If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

[Verse 2]
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it

Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind

And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close

74,Cry Pretty,Carrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

No, you can't cry

I like this Maybach Music, hahahaha

She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
I've tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (boom)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin' to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one

[Verse 3: Chris Brown  & Rick Ross]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm... (May-May-May)

Sorry, won't turn back the clock

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (uh)
Sayin', ""Sorry"", layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (boss)
The red bottoms got you walkin' funny (ha)
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)

Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her

I think I know I can, who says it's hard to reach?
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success?

Oh, why did God create this world so unfair?

My time went by too fast, there is no one left but me
I have got a nine to five and it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end, but I'm okay

Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay, when I lie down in your arms

[Verso 1]
La vida me empezó a cambiar
La noche que te conocí
Tenía poco que perder
Y la cosa siguió así
Yo con mis sostén a rayas
Y mi pelo a medio hacer
Pensé: ""Este todavía es un niño""
Pero, ¿qué le voy a hacer?

[Pre-Estribillo]
Es lo que andaba buscando
El doctor recomendando
Creí que estaba soñando, oh, oh
¿De qué me andaba quejando?
No sé qué estaba pensando
Voy pal cielo y voy pateando, oh, oh

[Estribillo]
Me enamoré,  me ena-na-namoré
Lo vi solito y me lancé
Me ena-na-namoré
Me ena-na-namo...
Mira que cosa bonita
Que boca más redondita
Me gusta esa barbita
Y bailé hasta que me cansé
Hasta que me cansé bailé
Y me ena-na-namoré
Nos enamoramos
Un mojito, dos mojitos
Mira que ojitos bonitos
Me quedo otro ratito

[Verso 2]
Contigo yo tendría 10 hijos
Empecemos por un par
Solamente te lo digo
Por si quieres practicar

[Pre Estribillo]
Lo único que estoy diciendo
Vayámonos conociendo
Es lo que he estao proponiendo, oh, oh
Nos vamos entusiasmando
Todo nos va resultando
Qué bien lo estamos pasando, oh, oh

Me enamoré, me ena-na-namoré
Lo vi solito y me lancé
Me ena-na-namoré

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)"

To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold

And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute

[Bridge]
If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute"
89,Boy,Lee Brice,"[Verse 1]
Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

[Verse 2]
You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy

[Bridge]
It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

[Outro]
But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two"

Switch place, story stay the same
Bail came in the mail, bust it down, you would think I'm Tory Lanez
Broke prayin' for a whole thang, shot the text and a load came

You think I'm really 'bout to let you bill it?

Big weight 'bout to go in the trunk, bad bitch, give me brain in the trunk

93,Glorious,Macklemore Featuring Skylar Grey,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
You know I'm back like I never left
Another sprint, another step
Another day, another breath
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept
I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious"

He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem
But then again, he’ll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord please

If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ay
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)
My little 15 minutes lasting long as hell, huh?

[Chorus: SZA]
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, broke hoes do what they can (can)
Good girls do what they told (told)
Bad bitches do what they want (they want)
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (give 'em none)
If they can't make you rich or they can't make you cum

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, ooh"

Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice

At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

When the new wears off, I don't even pack it

I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Ohhh, yeah
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

And any nigga go against the squad, you know I gotta make a call and that man killed (let me pop my shit, uh)
Two maybachs, couple milli, I'm feeling great
So much love when you barely can feel the hate
Them hoes love when you pulling up in that Wraith
For the love of that money your dog'll turn to a snake
Your homie turned to a rat, he is fighting his case
They talked in that federal and he praying they keep his state
He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said ""I'm telling my mom""
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised
What a nightmare
I'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there
Cops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here
And I ain't trying to lose nigga
Play it by the rules nigga
When you get that money watch the way them bitches choose nigga
Fuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga
Pussy taste good, but it won't feed you like no food nigga
We was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us
Took that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)
Pulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith
Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe
They shisty, got a nerve to even come to the wake
Seen your son and give him fuck if he ain't
That's why I'm cut throat
New bent truck ghost, I move
Get the upmost respect when I come through
Nigga, i get up close and personal
I bang on you vertical when I up toast
Move like I a ghost get the pie or you sell ghost, gang

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]

Put some respeck on my name
They got me feeling like baby
Diamonds they on me go crazy
Saint laurent on me no wavy
Fucking around we ain't fucking around I can't fuck with these niggas they shady
I know your jewelry fugazi
I know the jeweler who made it , fraud
I know these niggas gone talk about us
We getting money they talk about us
We never ever gone talk about us
We only trapping the tug a dollar
Wait, wait, wait
I'm tryna flip and get all the profits
I had his bitch and I ain't call him bout her
I tell that nigga ''I'm sorry about her""
Shotty popping in the dog filter
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, nigga
I'ma shoot him, I don't call niggas
On the deuce like Wall nigga
Cross her over hit her with the oooh
In the Wraith, stars in the roof
Light her up like Pikachu
In the ghost playing peek-a-boo
Wait, Niggas can't figure me out, hey
I keep a stick in the house, ay
I got a brick in the couch, ay
Sit on that shit in the drought, ay
Sell it for trip of the mount, ay
Stack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shipment, we sending 'em out , gang
I just got some brand new shmoney
I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

We went from selling cocaina
To selling out arenas
Yeah, get Louis flip flops pulling yachts out the marinas
Dirty young bulls living like you've never seen a
Flows on jalapena
My hoes on aquafina
I goes the la marina
The scoop and spanish broad
I met me a spanish plug
He getting Evander off, that Holyfield I hand him the cash
Throw me a raw, you know it's real
Ducking them indictments, it was so excitin'
Serving pipers that go to vegas, back when Floyd was fightin'
Carbon fiber 'rari the tire when we floor i'm buying
Bitches used to tell us we ugly now we being biased
We survivors, we beat them streets, young nigga we surviving
Walk in the building, look at the sheep when they see a lion
Totin' choppers, ducking narcotics, and we being beating bodies
Man I be getting niggas pussy just from being biased
Tell me I'm losing what do you mean?
Westbrook baby, no switching teams
Drop this triple double every time I'm on the scene
I won't claim that bitch, that's Billie Jean
She's not my lover
Lethal weapon, Danny Glover
O.J style when I cut her
Put my gloves up, say I'm not guilty I lucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Ball on these niggas every time I cop
Coming down Collins in a brand new drop
Hermes seats,  with my son lil pop
Watching cartoons in the back, spongebob
Wins and Losses, we in the building you already know its New York City
It's your boy Meek Milly
IT'S YOUR BOY MEEK MILLY IN THIS BITCH FATBOY WHAT'S UP

I spend that cause I earned it for myself
Got my shawty out the way and now I'm splurging on myself
You should worry 'bout yourself
I've been working on myself
I've been balling like I'm Curry, need a jersey for myself
(I need a jersey for myself)
What's next? I'm nervous for myself
If I changed, I became a better version of myself
Bought a chain, bought 2 more, yeah, I deserve that for myself
And my neighbors look at me like ""How he purchase that himself?""

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a seven-figure

So, which one you niggas made me?

112,Nothin' Like You,Dan + Shay,"[Verse 1]
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

[Verse 2]
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Verse 2]
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

[Verse 3]
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you

We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am...."

Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink

117,El Amante,Nicky Jam,"[Letra de ""El Amante""]

[Intro]
Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte, que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro como dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

[Coro]
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

[Post-Coro]
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más

[Verso 1]
Sólo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tienes frío, ¿quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tus fantasías
Nadie lo hace como yo

Si te viste bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí tú me gustas hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dices que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar

Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami, tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él
Eso lo decides tú

Que seas feliz con él
Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar
Cuando me extrañe tu piel (tu piel)

[Coro]
Ma-Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

[Coro]
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más

118,Deja Vu,Lauren Duski,"[Verse 1]
You never let me get away
From all the memories that we made
I got rid of the triggers, burned the pictures
But somehow you find a way
I woke up this morning, not thinking about you
Like I've taught myself to do
But in the still of the silence
I'm reminded of you...

[Interlude]
And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu

[Chorus]
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...



[Excluded from Music Video]
You... Déjà vu
Déjà vu

[Verse 2]
I won't ever get used to watching me lose you
Over and over again
I've gotten good pretending that I'm okay
But up here in my head
I see you close on the carpet, your arms all around me
On the floor in the living room
And I almost believed that
I'm really here with you

[Interlude]
And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu

[Chorus]
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...[Bridge]
You and I were meant to be
But only in a memory
You're all I want
You're all I see
It all comes back

[Chorus]
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning

And just like that, it all comes back to you

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months

Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

Walking with his head down

But would you run away with me?""

131,Preach,YoungBoy Never Broke Again,"[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
I turned the preacher daughter bad, I think I'm a devil
These niggas know what up, know I'm 'bout whateva
I'm in the streets, I keep that heat, you know that I be steppin'

[Verse 1]
I miss the Nawf just like my granny, my heart in them trenches
Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission
On my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision
Interrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it
I told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it
Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like ""Father, forgive me""
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em
Nigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something
I don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something
Bitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em
Bre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her

[Bridge]
This the files of a nigga who ain't neva bleed
This the story of a child who was in them streets
Why the fuck I'm taking care of them? They ain't do shit for me
Why the fuck I'm showing you so much love?
And bitch you leaving me

[Verse 2]
Keandre dead, the only thing I think about is Tyler
I'm full of pain but wake up every morning and I'm smilin'
They think I'm dumb, you got me fucked up, I got plenty knowledge
They don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems
Just 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said
I let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead
Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'
Montana know about my pain and everything I told him
I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him
Up in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me
YoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me

[Chorus]
Batty bwoy if you cross, I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of life
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', ""Red rum""
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Yo' ex just exposed you, now you mad like I was neva here
Where I come from I gotta keep this bitch up on my hip
Momma forgive me for all them times I use to trip
Know it's a purpose in this world why I need to live

[Interlude]
It ain't too long
Y'all don't give a fuck 'bout me, bitch
I did something for all y'all, y'all got me fucked up
Off the flap I ain't gotta smile in nobody face
Y'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?
Bitch I been feelin' like I'm finna die, bitch I cry alone
This for all, this for all them young niggas who gone
And all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?
Fuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang

[Chorus]
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', ""Red rum""
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Batty bwoy if you cross I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright

136,Hotel Key,Old Dominion,"[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key, ooh

But I think you need something to think of me
Something that will keep you warm

[Written by Lorde and Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Outro]
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat"

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let’s don’t talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen

[Chorus]
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

[Chorus]
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

[Chorus]
And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found

This job's just 9 to 5'ing my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Got a Yeti full of good ideas

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

Come on

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

[Interlude: Janet Jackson (J. Cole)]
Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change

Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

160,Heartache On The Dance Floor,Jon Pardi,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?"
161,Mary Did You Know,Jordan Smith,"Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod
When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

Oh, Mary, did you know
Mary, did you know
Ooh

Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Ooh, Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know
That your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is Heaven's perfect lamb
And the sleeping child you're holding
He is the great
The great I Am?

Mary, did you know?

162,Me Niego,Reik Featuring Ozuna & Wisin,"[Letra de ""Me Niego"" ft. Wisin, Ozuna]

[Verso 1: Reik, Ozuna]
Es difícil abrir mis ojos y ya no verte
Tu olor en la cama aún sigue intacto (oh-oh-oh)
Te he buscado en mis sueños deseándo tenerte
Y no encuentro tu rostro por más que trato

[Pre-Coro: Reik]
Aún quedan tus retratos
En cada rincón de la casa
Y el silencio me habla de ti
Es que sobra tanto espacio
Desde que no estás (oh-oh)
Daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte
Por que vuelvas

[Coro: Ozuna, Reik]
Es que me niego a perderte (a perderte)
A más nunca verte (nunca verte)
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Y es que me niego a perderte
A más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó
(que lo nuestro ya se acabó, Ozuna)

[Verso 2: Ozuna, Wisin]
No puedo asimilar
Que ya tú no estás, sin ti nada es igual
Sé que por el mundo no hay otra similar
¿Qué tú me hiciste que no te puedo olvidar?
Ay 'ombe, tú me quiere' a tu manera (pah-pah)
Mi mente quisiera que otra me quisiera (pah)
Mi corazón dice que por ti espera
Que porque volviera' daría lo que fuera (yeh)

[Puente: Ozuna, Wisin]
Pero es que tú chica con ese piquete (tah)
Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes (tah)
Ahora puedo decir sufrir de amor lo que se siente
Te sacaré 'e mi mente y eso será de repente
Pero es que tú chica con ese piquete
Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir sufrir de amor lo que se siente (oh-oh-oh)
Te sacaré 'e mi mente y eso será de repente (let's go)

[Coro: Reik]
Y es que me niego a perderte
A más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Y es que me niego a perderte
A más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó
(que lo nuestro ya se acabó)

[Puente: Reik, Wisin]
(Yo siento que me estoy muriendo)
Me está matando la soledad
Duele saber que ya no estás
Quiero pensar que todo esto es mentira (todo esto es mentira)
Y que al llamarte contestarás
Al llegar la noche regresarás
Aún podemos intentarlo (W)
No te alejes de mi vida
(yo sigo aquí confundido y solo, W)

[Verso 3: Wisin]
Llorando de noche, muriendo de día, viviendo esta agonía
No puedo entender que ya no seas mía
El círculo se cierra y el dolor me entierra (eh)
Qué difícil es vivir en esta guerra
Me niego (quiero estar contigo)
Aunque digas que estoy ciego
Desde que te fuiste soy un andariego (W)
A todo compromiso tarde le llego
Distraído, de tu foto no me despego (heh)
Si tú eres mi vida, por qué me liquidas (¿dime qué estás haciendo?)
Yo no provoqué tu partida (heh)
Necesito tu olor, necesito tu calor
Necesito verte encima de mí en ropa interior (oooh)

[Pre-Coro: Reik]
Aún quedan tus retratos
En cada rincón de la casa
Y el silencio me habla de ti
Es que sobra tanto espacio
Desde que no estás (no estás)
Daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte
Por que vuelvas

[Coro: Ozuna, Wisin, Reik]
Es que me niego a perderte
A más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó
Y es que me niego a perderte
A más nunca verte
Me niego a aceptar
Que lo nuestro ya se acabó

163,Say Something,Justin Timberlake Featuring Chris Stapleton,"Lately this depression been takin over my mind/
I’ve been tryna help the kids because that’s what I am inclined/
To do/
But I’ve got monsters in my head tryna take me to/

I try to tell myself that everything gone be okay/
But all these monsters in my head say that they here to stay/

Try not to listen to um/
But they inflicting pain/
These fricken demons in my head they just won’t go away

I start to think that they might just live inside of me/
But then again all these monsters do is lie to me/

At least I think they do/
Or maybe I just hope.../
Cuz if what they say is true well then I don’t know/

What the future holds/

I’m tryna make it through the pain/
I’m tryna see these brighter days/
But I can’t/
When everything I love always fades away/

Everything I love/
Everything I trust/
Everything I touch/
Always turns to dust/

I’ve got anxiety from everyone who’s lied to me
I used to be more open now I stay alone in privacy
When I was open people really never understood
So now I lie to people’s faces I say that I’m good
You don’t wanna hear it like this?
Well then don’t ask how I am
I think that’s why nobody talks to me cuz they don’t understand
So I just keep my struggles to myself
And focus on the music
But I’ve been feeling stressed out and I think I’m bout to lose it
And my smile don’t make me happy, if you think that you’re mistaken
Because every single day I swear I think my body’s breakin
And I feel like I’ve seen gods face
Still question faith
If I make one more mistake
Then I swear ima break
And I just want to know why I’m losin my mind
And there’s so many fricken things I wanna rewind
And there’s so many times in like that I wanna die
And I really wish that I could say this song was a lie

I got monsters under my bed
Monsters in my head
Monsters that won’t go away"

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you"

Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today

I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 1]
That money be callin', I don't do no talkin', so get the fuck outta my face
Gotta TEC and a chopper, with a hundred thousand dollars up in the Wraith
You know I ain't slippin', you know that I'm with it, I'll shoot him right up in his face
Three say that I'm trippin', you know that I'm drippin', I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from Goyard, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch, I ain't giving her shit, spend it all on my homies
I go put on my son, from my car to my house, everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin', I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 2]
I jump out at your house, I ain't shootin' from the corner
Ben bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin', I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin', I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case, yeah"

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

Growing up learning how to be like my old man

But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan

Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls

Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me

I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face

In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skrrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time, but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin' for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah, she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more"

Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan

There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life"

Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone
Unless you wanna come along

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have

You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play

Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism

Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

Ich weiß nicht, ob du es aushalten könntest
Ich weiß, du willst mich nackig, nackig, nackt sehen
Ich will dein Baby, Baby, Baby sein
Kreisend und es ist nass, als käme es aus Maytag
Weißes Mädchen betrunken von dem brauenen Drink
Wenn ich so werde, kann ich nicht um dich sein
Ich bin zu gut drauf, um eine Stufe herunterzuschalten
Weil ich könnte ein paar Sachen nennen, die ich machen werde

[Refrain: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wilde Gedanken
Wild, wild, wild
Wenn ich bei dir bin, sind alles, was ich bekomme, wilde Gedanken
Wild, wild, wild
Wenn ich bei dir bin, sind alles, was ich bekomme, wilde Gedanken

Lass uns loslegen!

[Strophe 2: Rihanna]
Ich hoffe du weißt ich bin zum Mitnehmen
Du weißt, dass dieser Keks zum Backen ist (ugh)
Kätzchen, Kätzchen, Baby, gib dem Ding ein bisschen Ruhe
Weil du bist damit fertig, es zu schlagen wie die '68 Jets
Diamanten sind Nichts, wenn ich mit dir rocke
Diamanten sind Nichts, wenn ich mit dir scheine
Lass es einfach schwarz und weiß, als wäre ich deine Schwester
Ich bin zu hip, um mit dir hier draußen in der Stadt mit dir herumzulaufen

Fick dich, bis du völlig verausgabt bist, Einäscherung
Mach es cremig, yeah, Wu-Tang
Wirf den Arsch zurück, Brautstrauß
Ruf mich an und ich mache es saftig
Ich merke du hast D'usse getrunken
Vorsichtig, Mama, pass auf, was du sagst
Du redest mit mir als sei ich dein neues Bae
Diese Pfeiffe jetzt sorgte dafür, dass sie rennt, als wäre sie Usain, Baby
Du sorgst dafür, dass ich darin ertrinke, touche, Baby
Ich trage das Wasser, Bobby Boucher, Baby
Du weißt ich schlachte, als wäre ich Jason
Spreng es, warum hast du es auf Sicherheit?
Weißes Mädchen betrunken von dem braunen Drink
Ich sollte wahrscheinlich nicht um dir sein
Weil du wirst wild, wild, wild
Du siehst aus, als gäbe es nicht, was du nicht machen würdest

Yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it (Not make it)
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, ""It's different strokes for different folks""
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her, ""You don't gotta make it difficult""
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it (Not make it)
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Outro: Belly]
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no, I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no, I might not make it (Ooh)"
195,Downtown's Dead,Sam Hunt,"[Intro]
""Thanks, Hannah, thanks for coming back""

[Verse 1]
The city’s so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, I love these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there’s no one here but me

[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead

[Verse 2]
They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything’s a blur
I don’t hear the words, but lips are moving
Try to get involved, but I’ve 'bout had enough of people wall to the wall
And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause...

[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead

[Bridge]
Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit… I’ve had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can’t get you out of my head
I’m calling it a night
I’m crawling back to your bed…

[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say ""hi""
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red

Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
I can't talk right now
I'm lookin' and I like what I'm seein'
Got me feelin' kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now
Even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it, get it, when it's hot right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for whatever happens next

[Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So, if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
""What's your name, your sign"" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for whatever happens next

[Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So, if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault

[Bridge]
Baby, one, two, three
Your body's callin' me
And I know wherever you're at is exactly where I wanna be
But don't blame me
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope)
It ain't my fault
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Chorus]
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
No-oh-oh, it ain't my fault
No-oh-oh, no-oh-oh, no (Nope, nope, nope, nope…)
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
Well, that's too bad, it ain't my fault"
202,Feel No Ways,Drake,"[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say

203,Somebody To Love,Jordan Smith,"Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Each morning I get up
I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry

Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!

Somebody (somebody)
Oh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)

I take home (goes home)
My hard earned pay all on my own
(Goes home on his own)
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes

Lord, somebody
(Somebody)
Oh, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Every day (every day)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down

They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in the brain
Oh, I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Oh, I just got to get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free

(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
Oh

Love, love

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Hey, yeah
(Find me somebody to love)
Whoa
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody to love"
204,This Is It,Scotty McCreery,"[Verse 1]
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in (Take it in)
This is a moment we won't forget (Won't forget)
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it"
205,Otherside,Post Malone,"[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?"

Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to

Everybody ain't got it, understand son (sorry)
Yeah, this shit is not random

[Verse 2]
Now imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
Wasn't blowin' money, I was stackin' it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happenin' by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashin' it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference now I finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothin'?
You must be mistakin' someone
I had to go make that fundin'
I'm tryna be great at somethin'
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flyin' from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothin', shh
Now try and shade me, I'm like, ""I guess""
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign CDs and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex
Listen

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
I got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
Yeah, this shit is not random"

208,Any Ol' Barstool,Jason Aldean,"[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

209,At My Best,Machine Gun Kelly Featuring Hailee Steinfeld,"[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about..."
210,The Night We Met,Lord Huron,"[Verse 1]
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2]
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Verse 3]
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"

212,Break The Rules,Charli XCX,"[Verse 1]:
Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]:
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Verse 2]:
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]: (2x)
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 2]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]:
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]:
Na na na na na na na"
213,Believe,Mumford & Sons,"[Intro/Segue]

[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Verse 2]
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind"
214,A Million Dreams,P!nk,"[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one’s been before
But it feels like home

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don’t care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Verse 2]
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it’s gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we’re gonna make

[Bridge]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see

[Chorus]
Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Outro]
For the world we're gonna make"
215,U With Me?,Drake,"[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

América, por favor toma mi mano
¿Puedes ayudarme a enten—
New Kung Fu Kenny

[Verso 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tira un filete fuera del arca
A una piscina llena de tiburones, él lo tomará
Déjalo en el desierto
Con un enemigo de muerte, él lo hará
Aprovéchate de su gratitud
Apuesto que te mostrará algo, whoa
Mataré a un negro por nada
Mataré a un negro por nada
Mataré a un negro por nada
Mataré a un negro, luego tiraré el arma en su regazo
Camino hacia la corte como ""Perra, ¡yo hice eso!""
Clasificado X
Johnny no quiere ir a la escuela sin dinero, sin dinero
Johnny dijo que los libros no son cool sin dinero (sin dinero)
Johnny quiere ser un rapero como su primo grande
Johnny atrapó un cuerpo ayer fuera de casa
Dios bendiga a América, sabes que todos lo amamos

[Verso 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayer recibí una llamada de mi amigo como a las 1:01 AM
Dijo que mataron a su único hijo por fondos insuficientes
Él estaba llorando, estaba molesto de manera agresiva y borracho
Hablando en su cabeza, filosofando de porque el Señor lo había hecho
Él dijo: ""K-Dot, ¿puedes orar por mí?
Ha sido un día jodido para mí
Sé que estás bendecido, enséñame cómo superarlo.""
Él estaba buscando aceptarlo
Esperando que pudiera acercarlo más
A lo espiritual, mi espíritu no lo hace mejor, pero le dije
""No puedo endulzarte la respuesta, esto es como me siento:
Si alguien mata a mi hijo, eso significa
Que alguien será asesinado.""
Dime lo que haces por amor, lealtad y pasión de
Todos los recuerdos recogidos, momentos de los que nunca podrías regresar
Voy a esperar en frente del lugar de los negros y verlo andar en su bloque
Voy a agarrar a un negro dejando el servicio si eso es todo lo que tengo
Mataré a un negro, luego tiraré el arma en su regazo
Camino hacia la corte como ""Perra, ¡yo hice eso!""
No hay poder negro cuando tu bebé muere por un cobarde
Ni siquiera puedo mantener la paz, no jodas con ningunos de los nuestros
Será asesinato en la calle, serán cuerpos a la hora
Un helicóptero estará en la calle, paramédicos en la línea
Deja que alguien toque a mi mamá
Toque a mi hermana, toque a mi mujer
Toque a mi papá, toque a mi sobrina
Toque a mi sobrino, toque a mi hermano
Deberías matar a un negro luego tirar el arma en su regazo
De hecho, estoy a punto de hablar en esta convención
Te llamaré—

[Interludio: Kendrick Lamar]
Muy bien, niños, vamos a hablar sobre el control de armas
(Reza por mí) ¡Maldita sea!

[Coro: Bono]
No es un lugar
Este país es para mí un sonido
De batería y bajo
Cierra los ojos para mirar alrededor

[Verso 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Viva María, Jesús y José
La gran bandera americana está envuelta en arrastre con explosivos
Trastorno compulsivo, hijos e hijas
Bloques de barricadas y fronteras
¡Mira lo que nos enseñaste!
Es un asesinato en mi calle, tu calle, calles secundarias
Wall Street, oficinas corporativas
Bancos, empleados y jefes con
Pensamientos homicidas; Donald Trump está en el cargo
Perdimos a Barack y prometimos no volver a dudar de él
¿Pero es América honesta, o nos regocijamos en el pecado?
Pasa la ginebra, la mezcló con sangre americana
Entonces golpéalo, eres un Crip o te casaste con Blood?
Te preguntaré de nuevo — Ups, accidente
Es desagradable cuando nos instalamos
Luego tira los dados, luego apostarnos
De la noche a la mañana los rifles grandes, entonces dile a Fox que nos tenga miedo
Pandilleros o terroristas, etcétera, etcétera
Las reflexiones de E.E.U.U sobre mí, eso es lo que hace un espejo

218,Undrunk,FLETCHER,"[Intro]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

[Verse 1]
Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't want to face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do? (Haha)
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, be spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Bridge]
Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But somethings you can't undo
And one of them's you

[Outro]
You, you
Wish I could un-love you, you
You, you
Wish I could un-call you, you
You, you
Wish I could un-fuck you, you
Wish I could un-love you"
219,1985 (Intro To The Fall Off),J. Cole,"1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga"

Woah, yeah, man, T.I.P. in this motherfucker with me, nigga!
To the max with it, racks!
I count six shots

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bustin' out the bando (woo)
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener (bling)
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip (woo)
I went from Smart Card to a bitch with some smart lips (skrrt)
And the F&N make my hip limp (gah)
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dimps (woo)
And my bank roll got a big dip (woo)
She gon' bring it on a big ship (sheesh, sheesh)
Quite trill, no QuikTrip (sheesh, sheesh)
I got thugs in the alley, know Tip here (woo)
And she just wanna have a good day (what)
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A (damn, damn)
I want them birds 'til next May (goddamn)
Never let 'em fly away
What!? I heard, hey buddy
Listen what my nigga Tip say

[Chorus: T.I.]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah, I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit

Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I’ll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho (woo)
Learned that from UGK back in ""Pocket Full of Stones""
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga, no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well, I don't respond to no nigga
No murder, no dough, no convo, nigga

Don't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up

BA-BOW! Ayy, know you better be (better be)
On your best behavior when addressin' me

222,Hallelujah,Leonard Cohen,"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 5]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 6]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 7]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah"

M-M-Murda

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like ""nah""

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, ""Babe, I think I love you, kinda""
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word"

Ain't nobody prayin' for me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'"
225,L$D,A$AP Rocky,"[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

I look for ways to say, ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs

Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication"
228,Once An Addict (Interlude),J. Cole,"[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall

Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash

But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike

But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

231,I'd Just Love To Lay You Down,Barrett Baber,"OUTSIDE HARLEM'S PARADISE

The ESU team is shackling Luke for arrest.

COP: All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him. Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy. Bravo team will bring up the rear. Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.

COP: Copy that. You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.

LUKE: This isn't necessary.

COP: Yeah, it is.

Misty is looking on from her ambulance. She gets up and starts walking towards Luke.

PARAMEDIC: No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight...Ms. Knight!

MISTY: It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine. (to the ESU guy) I need a moment with Cage.

ESU GUY: Misty, we have special orders.

MISTY: Mario, come on. I was just held hostage. I just need a minute with him.

ESU GUY: All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.

COP: Clear!

MISTY (ostentatiously): You going down. It's about damn time. Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there? ...Look, your friend is in the wind. They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs for the whole world to see so they're not looking for anybody else. Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets. I wouldn't try anything if I were you...before I got to the precinct.
You're not that crazy, are you?

LUKE: Always.

MISTY: Take his ass to jail.

COP: Come on.

COP: All right, let's go. We're rolling.

They load Luke into the truck and drive away. The two cops in the front seat discuss him.

COP 1: Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?

COP 2: The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.

COP 1: It's a shit detail. You'd think ESU would be in the back with those guns pointed at him.

COP 2: We've got the same guns and bullets they do.

COP 1: You know, my wife says it's the end of days, people like him popping up.

COP 2: They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple. Cage? He's evolution.

COP 1: Whatever he is, it's just scary. Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

COP 2: Insecure? You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back. At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.

COP 1: I was fast asleep when she came home. Your daughter already wore me out.

In the back of the van, Luke easily breaks his shackles.

COP 2: Just sit tight.

COP 1: God damn it. Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?

COP 1 (To the woman, over megaphone): You are in the path of a police convoy. Clear the road immediately.

Luke breaks out of the van and runs.

COP 1 (over megaphone): Cage must not escape. Fire at will!

The cops chase Luke through alleys. Luke comes to a dead end and slams into a side door. He slips through the building and ocmes out on the other side. He sees a police car drive past him and relaxes, but then hears the sound of a shotgun behind him.

COP 2: Young cops always wanna chase somebody. Me? I'd rather be where they're already going. They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you. You don't want to die? Don't run.

LUKE: I'd rather die than go back to prison.

COP 2: Live free or die? You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit? Fine with me. Cop killers don't survive these streets.

LUKE: I didn't kill a cop. My problem isn't with you or yours. It's much bigger than that.

COP 2: Some people are calling you a hero for what you did. Connie's, Pop's...

LUKE: I'm no hero. But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.

COP 2: You don't recognize me, do you?

LUKE: I've seen you at Pop's before.

COP 2: Pop cut my hair for 12 years. He didn't think he was a hero, either. He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong....I hope I'm right about you. More people rooting for you than you think.

The cop lowers his gun.

LUKE: What are you gonna tell your people?

COP 2: The truth. I had you in my sights, but you outran me. I'm getting old...Luke? You better catch that slippery son of a bitch.

Luke turns and leaves.

OPENING THEME

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

THEMBI WALLACE (newscast): Moments after the tumultuous events at Harlem's Paradise, fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke Cage was brought out in handcuffs. And now the city's most...

TURK: Hey, I'm glad you called me, Willis. Luke Cage is on the run. They got Shades in bracelets, but they're gonna be onto you before long, brother. Best believe that. Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash, that was the right move.

STRYKER: I wouldn't touch any of that. People don't test me more than once.

TURK: I overstand. What you need me for?

STRYKER: I understand you're a man of discretion and taste with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares. I can still collect from the shadows.

Zip comes in, wearing a pair of sunglasses.

ZIP: Bad news, Diamondback.

STRYKER: Take those off!

ZIP: I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.

Stryker walks over to Zip and grabs his throat, choking him and pushing him to the ground. He holds him there for a moment before he starts to laugh and lets him go.

STRYKER: I had you, didn't I? I couldn't resist. I like you, Zip. You've got ambition. It'll take you far as long as you stay in your place. The first of the 48 laws of power. Never outshine the master. That was the mistake Shades made. He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far. He was on some Icarus shit. Do you know who that is?

ZIP:  Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.  Right?

TURK: No Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.

ZIP: Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.

STRYKER: Not for long.

ZIP: You gonna blow the joint up?

STRYKER: No, he's going to be bailed out.

ZIP: The hell for? That don't make no sense!

STRYKER: See? The questioning. That's how it starts...I'm gonna have an opening. You gonna step up?

ZIP: I'm down to do whatever you need. No problem.

STRYKER: Good boy. So are you down?

TURK: I'm down. As long as the business is business, I'm good with it. Till then, I'm out of here, man.

ZIP: Show Turk out, Zip.

TURK: Romeo would roll over in his grave, the way you hop-skipping with these cats nowadays. He was a man on these streets. You's a boy.

ZIP: What the hell are you talking about? You're down here in his pocket, same as me.

TURK: I'm doing business with him, yes. But I ain't his boy. And I definitely ain't his bitch.

Turk leaves, and Zip walks back to Stryker.

ZIP: These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit they don't even know about. So what's in the box?

STRYKER: One of the seven deadly sins, my boy which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.

ZIP: Which one?

STRYKER: Wrath.

COLON'S GYM

ERNESTO (in Spanish): This Diamondback needs to be dealt with.

ADVISER (in Spanish): Ernesto is right, Domingo. This is the perfect time to do it. We've got the muscle. Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican, Dominican and Haitian leaders dead, we can control the drugs, guns, all of it and walk out like kings.

DOMINGO (in English): I was there when he took them all out. Right next door. We got the drugs. We got that money. But with the guns, we can control everything. Here, the islands, further south...We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

ERNESTO (in Spanish) So what are you saying?

DOMINGO: We take him out. We go after what's ours. Let's go find Diamondback.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Shades is standing for his mugshot. Misty watches him through the window.

OFFICER: Turn and face the camera.

RIDLEY: You're supposed to be in the hospital. Push yourself too hard too soon and you could make it worse, you know.

MISTY: I appreciate your concern.

RIDLEY: No, you don't. I need you at 100%.

MISTY: I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

RIDLEY: Well, the hostages have all been consistent that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.

MISTY: He was set up. You know it, Priscilla. Half this damn department knows it. We need to be going after Willis Stryker.

RIDLEY: Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

MISTY: He's a black man being chased by the cops oh, with special bullets. Accused of killing a cop, and you're asking why he's running? Come on.

RIDLEY: Look at how relaxed Hernan ""Shades"" Alvarez is. He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon, so he's resting up. He knows he's guilty. See this perp? Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous. No wonder his street name is Sugar. I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks. He's probably innocent or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.

MISTY: That's a detectives' wives' tale. You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.

RIDLEY: Oh, but you can...because Luke gave you his word.

MISTY: Luke...

RIDLEY: Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.

MISTY: Luke Cage saved my life.

RIDLEY: I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback, but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.

MISTY: Okay, well, let me lead the charge. Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

RIDLEY: He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van. Now they will shoot him on sight with the mayor's blessing.

MISTY: You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades. He's in deep with all the players. He doesn't scare me.

RIDLEY: Detective...

MISTY: I can handle him.

RIDLEY: You just got shot. I need you to go home, get some rest. I'll interview Shades.

THE RUINED HARLEM'S PARADISE

MARIAH: My grandmother loved Harlem's Paradise. She took care of all the small details. She loved it. From the murals the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens. No fine point was overlooked. This was her legacy. My family's in tatters, and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit! Uh, I know, I know I need to get out in front of this. Release a statement about Damon Boone and how much I respected him.

ALEX: That is not what I was gonna say.

MARIAH: Well, yeah, just Please, no lectures.

ALEX: This is just a thing. Things can be rebuilt, and when you do, you rebuild it as your legacy. Not just the clubs. I want to be a part of that...Here's what I think. Controlling the narrative is everything. We can't have any loose threads. So anyone who might have overheard anything you said to Diamondback or Shades in here is a threat.

MARIAH: You're absolutely correct.

ALEX: How may I be of service?

MARIAH: I wouldn't want you to do anything untoward.

ALEX: Never.

MARIAH: Okay.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Luke is skulking around in daylight, in his bullet-riddled hoodie.He hides from a police car, then sees two men pull on balaclavas and enter a bodega.

LUKE: I don't have time for this.

Inside the bodega, one robber is holding a gun on the owner and Method Man while the other empties the register.

ROBBER 1: Don't move. He'll blow your head off. He's crazy like that. Don't try no shit.

The robber suddenly recognizes Method Man. He pulls up his mask

ROBBER 1: My bad, Meth. I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit. But you know how it is.

METHOD MAN: Are you serious? Are you really trying to have a conversation right now?

ROBBER 1: I'm just tryin'...I'm just sayin'...You're the man, yo.

ROBBER 2: Pull your mask down! You supposed to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

BRYCE: What I say about using my government name, Michael?

Luke walks in

BRYCE: Damn, homie. You look like you went through a cheese grater. Oh, snap, you Luke...

Luke smacks Bryce hard enough to knock him into a display. Michael panics and shoots at Luke several times.

MICHAEL: I ain't mean that.

LUKE: Give me your phone. The phone, fool.

MICHAEL: Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit when you threw my mans across the...

Luke flicks Michael in the head and knocks him out.

METHOD MAN: It's you. Yeah, it's you.

LUKE: No, man, it's you. Yo, man, ""P.L.O. Style"" was my joint back in the day. Sweet Christmas. Yeah, man, one second.

Luke makes a phone call.

LUKE: Hey, it's me...Yeah, they'll be looking for me. I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.

Luke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.

LUKE: You a double XL?

METHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.

They trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers' gun.

LUKE: Call the cops.

BODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.

LUKE: They can keep their money.

METHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?

BODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Misty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

CANDACE: Detective Knight?

MISTY: Candace?

CANDACE: Yeah.

MISTY: What number are you calling me from?

CANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.

MISTY: Come into the precinct.

CANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.

MISTY: You didn't wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?

CANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?

MISTY: Where are you?

CANDACE: Look, if you can't help...

MISTY: Candace.

CANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.

INTERROGATION ROOM

RIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive. And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?

SHADES: Law...yer.

RIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won't be walking away from that. That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.

SHADES: Are you serious?

RIDLEY: Yep.

SHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.

RIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?

SHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?

Shades laughs Ridley out the door.

THE WATERSIDE

CANDACE: You call this safe?

MISTY: We're hiding in plain sight. I've got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.

CANDACE: It's not bullshit.

MISTY: We'll see. How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?

CANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.

MISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that's so important?

CANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.

MISTY: I already know that.

CANDACE: I mean right after.

Misty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the ""record"" button.

CANDACE: Mariah killed him.

Misty pictures herself in Harlem's Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.

SHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....

MISTY: How do you know this?

CANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.

SHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...

CANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.

MISTY: Why are you coming clean now?

CANDACE: 'Cause I can't live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.

Misty stops recording and puts her phone away.

Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said ""You never know what anyone is capable of."" It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.

MISTY: I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall. Who else knows that you're here?

CANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.

MISTY: Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.

CANDACE: Okay.

Misty hands her a new burner.

MISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It's already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it's me.

CANDACE: Is your arm okay?

MISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.
Come on, let's go.

CANDACE: Where?

MISTY: Soledad's. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem's Paradise. She'll be there, too. I'm gonna take you there myself.

Nearby, Alex watches them from a car.

SWAY'S STUDIO

METHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

HEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don't believe that.

METHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin' and shit. Look, I'm telling y'all the truth. I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.
Trust me, it's the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain't calling no po-po...Then he bounced.

SWAY: Say word.

METHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I'm telling you. He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.

HEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?

METHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!

SWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.

HEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?

METHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened. As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.

SWAY: That's what's up, man. You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

METHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.

SWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.

HEATHER B: No doubt.

SWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?

METHOD MAN: Of course.

SWAY: Oh, man! He 'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!

METHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. ""Bulletproof Love"" your way, brother.

During this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.

Let's get it.
Listen.
Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, ""empty out the drawer"" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one

[Hook: Method Man]
Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby
The streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'? People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You're already bulletproof love, baby!

SWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.
Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

THE BARBERSHOP

THEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.

SWAY: Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?

CALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.

Fish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.

SWAY: I wouldn't put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...

Fish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.

OFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.

FISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.

Smith walks over to Fish's chessboard.

SMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?

FISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.

SMITH: Oh. That's deep. If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.

FISH: Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.

The cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.

FISH: That was a close shave.

LUKE: Bad pun.

FISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?

LUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.

FISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you're bulletproof. You'd have never seen my black ass again. I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what's the plan?

LUKE: To box in all the players.

FISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?

LUKE:  No, she's got her hands full already. She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.

FISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.

Fish gets up and goes to the wall phone.

LUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb. If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.

FISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it's Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?

INTERROGATION ROOM

Ridley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.

SHADES: Who's this?

RIDLEY: First name ""Law,"" last name ""Yer."" Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.

SHADES: Membership has its privileges.

In the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.

MISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don't you? You got this all figured out, huh?

SHADES: No. Actually, I don't.

UNDER A BRIDGE

Zip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.

SHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

ZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.

They all walk into an abandoned factory.

ZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.

SHADES: Don't ever question my loyalty.

They all step into a old service elevator.

SHADES: The man upstairs?

ZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...

Zip wraps a cord around Shades' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion's gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.

SHADES: Let's go to the penthouse.

THE ROOF

ZIP: I was just following orders!

SHADES: You're a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?

ZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.

SHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You're such a disappointment.

ZIP: You're the second person who told me that today. I'm my own man, Shades.

SHADES: Tell him yourself.

Shades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip's pocket.

SHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

MARIAH: It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I'm glad you found the park. So where is she now?

ALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.

MARIAH: We'll find her again. Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you're my rock! Later.

Mariah's phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.

MARIAH: What do you want?

STRYKER (over the phone): That's no way to speak to a business partner.

MARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?

STRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.

MARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?

STRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.
So now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I'd hate for us to part, too.

MARIAH: I wasn't particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I'm out of the political game. I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.

Instead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.

STRYKER: That's a smart move. But you've made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.

He drops a duffel bag in front of her.

STRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.

MARIAH: It's a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.

STRYKER: You're right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We'll be doing this for years to come.

MARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?

STRYKER: Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate. But don't worry. You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Turk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.

LUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.

TURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

LUKE: I should crush you.

TURK: You won't, though. You need me.

LUKE: Where's Diamondback?

TURK: I don't know.

Luke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk's body.

LUKE: You still stalling?

TURK: All right! All right! He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!

LUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.

TURK: You can't leave me in here! There's baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Domingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.

DOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.

STRYKER: I'm a man who needs his space.

DOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.

STRYKER: Whoa, whoa.

Domingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker's men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.

DOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That's not Cage's style so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

STRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.

Stryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.

DOMINGO: I'm gonna rip your head off!

Eventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.

STRYKER: ""And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death.""

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

Mariah is counting Stryker's cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.

SHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?

MARIAH: No.

SHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

MARIAH: No, he didn't.

SHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.

MARIAH: Shut up.

SHADES: I have something for you. Figured you'd want this.

He holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.

SHADES: Your prints, Cornell's blood.

MARIAH: Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.

SHADES: I don't need it. We're in this together now.

MARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.

SHADES: You're talking about Luke Cage? It's incredible how much you and I think alike. We're at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

MARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?

SHADES: Absolutely. 'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.

He pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.

His old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.

MARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.

SHADES: Even better.

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Luke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn't quite dead yet.

DOMINGO: I should've known you'd turn up.

LUKE: What the hell happened here?

DOMINGO: Diamondback.

Luke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker's crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.

LUKE: Sweet sister.

Cut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.

LUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?

DOMINGO: Something I've never seen before. Even you can't stop him.

Domingo dies.

THE STATIONHOUSE

The shot of Domingo's death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty's wall.

MISTY: These just came in.

BAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.

MISTY: Mmm-hmm.

BAILEY:That's gotta be Cage, right?

Misty's cell phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

LUKE (over the phone): Hey, it's me. You guys find Domingo?

MISTY: Yeah.

LUKE: Meet me.

MISTY: Where?

She quickly gathers her things and leaves.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Misty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.

MISTY: Should I thank you for this?

LUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.

MISTY: I don't suppose we'll find his body. We found Zip's, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.

LUKE: Shades. Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?

MISTY: Yes. Look, it's not safe for you to be here. If you don't find Diamondback...

LUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.

MISTY: Is there anything I can do?

LUKE: See what else Turk knows. He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

MISTY: A dumpster?

OUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH

Mariah and Shades are sitting in a car.

MARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.

SHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.

MARIAH: I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.

SHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn't regret that.

MARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?

SHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.

MARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.

SHADES: So what are you saying?

MARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.

SHADES: You ready?

MARIAH: I stay ready, baby.

They climb out of the car and walk into

THE BARBERSHOP

FISH: I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.

MARIAH: Where's Luke Cage?

LUKE: I'm right here.

SHADES:We have a problem.

LUKE: So do I. I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first. Where's Diamondback?

SHADES: I don't know. The parley between the three of us is more important.

LUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.

FISH: Luke, be cool, brother.

MARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.

LUKE: There's no way I'm helping you.

MARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.

LUKE: You both framed me for murder. There's nothing you can offer me that's going to make me let that go.

SHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.

LUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.

MARIAH: I'll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You'll go free.

Misty emerges from the back room.

SHADES:What the hell is this?

MISTY: Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

LUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?

MISTY: I've been tracking you since you called. I wasn't going to let you just ghost me again.

LUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We're working this out.

MISTY: Oh, so you workin' with them now?

LUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.

SHADES: I didn't say that.

MISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.

SHADES: I ain't telling you shit.

Something drops to the ground right outside the shop.

LUKE: Grenade!

Everyone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.

FISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

STRYKER: No, I'm the angel of death.

SHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?

MARIAH: No.

STRYKER: Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach. Your mama should have named you Pedro.

Shades lifts his gun and fires at Stryker. The bullets ricochet off of his suit.

MARIAH: Shades!

FISH: God damn it! I just fixed this place up all perfect and shit! Y'all can't take this outside?

LUKE & STRYKER: No.

FISH: All right, just just sayin'.

LUKE (to Misty): Don't let Mariah get away.

MISTY: I won't. Kick his ass, Luke.

STRYKER: You know I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?

LUKE: You have to get past me first.

STRYKER: Oh, I don't go past. I go through.

They both yell and charge each other before the screen goes black."
232,My Strange Addiction,Billie Eilish,"[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?"
233,Make It Rain,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 2]
Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 3]
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

[Chorus (Extended)]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain"

That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Bridge]
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast"

What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ayy

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy

Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy

If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mill, sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeah

239,Go Ahead And Break My Heart,Blake Shelton Featuring Gwen Stefani,"[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

[Pre-Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Oh no, here I go

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Oh no, here I go

Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart

[Outro: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends

[Припев: XXXTENTACION]
Не плачь, не уходи
Не буду лгать - я чертовски тебя люблю
О да!

[Куплет 1: Lil Wayne]
Ты смотришь в облака
Это я поднимаюсь или они опускаются?
Я вижу смерть за углом
А знак разворота выглядит как улыбка
Что же мне теперь делать? Кто меня теперь найдет и как?
Некуда идти, кроме как по кругу
Еще один ниггер, который потерял голову
Нет, гребаный король, который забыл свою корону
Я не номер один и это правда
Я номер 9-27-82
Дальтоник, даже если я синий
Моя тарелка полна, это не моя любимая еда
Но я голоден, так голоден
Мне нужно мое родовое дерево рядом с денежным деревом
С кучей листьев в Эдемском саду
С кучей Eves, фруктовым пуншем
Я пью из фонтана молодости
Так что, если я умру молодым - обвиню сок
Похороните меня в Новом Орлеане
И напишите на плите: «Не плачь, следи за ней»
Верни меня к жизни
Потерять жизнь ради жизни
Но если рай настолько хорош, как о нем говорят
Я хочу трехкратное продление моей чертовой жизни
Покойся с миром

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)
Я чертовски тебя люблю (не плачь, не плачь)

[Куплет 2: Lil Wayne]
Талант дан Богом, будь благодарен
Слава не дана, будь смиренным
А тщеславие появляется само, будь осторожен
Оставайся на своей собственной полосе, пристегнись
А иногда, когда нет музыки
Мы рождаем наши собственные рога, рум-бум-бум-бум
Эта женщина перенесла будущее
И Tunechi родился как «dun-dun-dun-dun»
Не называйте это возвращением
Было темно, а теперь солнце
Мне тяжело, но я повернул назад
Колеса отвалились, я поехал на ободах
Это самоубийством – вопрос жизни и смерти
Это более новые дни и это голубые небеса
Я сказал себе: «Это просто ты и я»
Затем повеял ветер и он свел меня с ума
Господь знает, кто я там
Я делаю последнее дыхание
Мама скажи, чтобы я был осторожен
Голос в голове дает мне нагоняй
Я получил контроль над сознанием
Я потерял контроль, но знал, что найду его
Я позволил Богу контролировать то, что я не могу
Невозможно контролировать слезы, позволить им падать и катиться

[Припев: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь)
Не уходи (почему? ну почему?)
Не буду лгать, я чертовски тебя люблю
Не плачь (не плачь, не плачь, не плачь)
Не пойди (почему? почему? почему? ну почему?)
Не будет лгать (не плачь, не плачь)
Я чертовски тебя люблю (не плачь, не плачь)

[Аутро: Lil Wayne]
Не плачь, оставайся с нами
И трехкратно продли мою чертову жизнь
Покойся с миром"

Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

Won't get past a lunch break

In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talk about me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Better day than yesterday

You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
Got damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her
Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, ""French, take me to Paris""
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, let me grab it""
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, make it nasty""
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses
I ain't lookin' at you niggas, lookin' way past you
Young, fly, G's up, pocket full of cash
You know where to find me, you know when you need me
All my dogs eat, they'll tell you I ain't greedy
I ain't gon' love her, too much to leave her
I ain't goin' public, surely is easy
Pull up with my niggas, make a move
Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', had no business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
And I come through fly (check) no co-sign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (check) and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in the streets tryna feed the babies
The single mama's workin' hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doin' it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 3: YG]
Last time that I checked, I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact
This real, this ain't rap, where everybody wanna act pro-black
(They don't really wanna fuck with us) The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that, ""I done made it out the gutter"" shit
Nip told you ""Fuck the middle man"", I told you ""Fuck a bitch""
Fuck wearin' their clothes, I wear my own shit
Ya'll can own ya'll label, I own my own, bitch!
Aye Nip, I remember all that game you taught me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win though, don't let that game fold you
Cause when this game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be givin' game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked"

I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion

253,We The People....,A Tribe Called Quest,"[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go

[Bridge: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go"

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

This what God feel like

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm than show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there

Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care

257,Intro,J. Cole,"[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2]
Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said ""that's for busters,"" then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down

[Interlude]
Ha, yeah nigga
Hell yeah, I felt that one in my fuckin' soul

[Outro: Erykah Badu]

258,Victory Lap,Nipsey Hussle Featuring Stacy Barthe,"[Intro: Stacy Barthe]
Woah, oh-woah, woah, ohh
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets"" (ohh)
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher in front of yo buildin'
Sitting on the steps feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnit proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bulletproof Soul""
Every few shows I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown diamond district, jewelers like ""Yo
Hussle holler at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
And docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curbed detectives
Guess it's... evidence of a divine presence
Blessings, help me out at times I seem reckless
F it
Got a L, but got an E for effort, stretch it
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, and left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money makin' Nip
Straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Matchin' champagne bottles from Ricos til' T show
Whatever, nigga, we playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See bro, if you ain't live and die by the street codes
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I want to hear your CD for?

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
(Woah) Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
(Woah) Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
(Woah) Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""
(We gotta make it) Like the beginning of ""Mean Streets""

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there, this time around I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air, fuck it though, ya'll niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They don't see in due time, I be makin' mil's
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
This just another front step with candles
Lil message from the set, ""We accept your challenge""

[Outro: Stacy Barthe]
Woah, oh-woah, woah, ohh
Woah, woah
We gotta make it
Yeah we gotta
We gotta make
Oh, we gotta make it
Ohh, ooh
We gotta make it, ohh

259,Remedy,Adele,"[Verse 1]
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars

[Chorus]
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy

[Verse 2]
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth and I will always love you
Love you, oh

[Chorus]
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be, I will be
I will be your remedy

262,The Old Rugged Cross,Craig Wayne Boyd,"On a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the Old Rugged Cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach, gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

And I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Yeah, I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown"

From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong

[Verse]
I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down

Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together

[Collision: The Game]
You want me to say your name, huh?
Karrueche!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

[Outro: Jeremih]
All eyes on me
All eyes on me"

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
That’s my fam, I’ll hold ‘em down forever
Us against the word, we can battle whoever
Together ain’t no way gonna fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nunchucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my rolex they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Madsonik]
All for one when we fight together
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
All for one when we fight together
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
This family can bear any weather
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ain't nothing that could come in between me and my brothers
We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Family, ain't nothing strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes

They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
Thats part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Four hittas, four winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us
We be them, we be them, young ridahs
Raised in the gutters, really started from the bottom
We all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Give me the whole pie, real cheesy

Takin' pics for me, told her smile for me
Pass her off I'm a real team player
Bandanna on my face like a gangster

Put metal in my nose like Pain (Uh)
Man, I never saw this bitch before (Uh)
How the fuck she know my name?
She said, ""Lil Uzi, hello"" (Uh)
I looked at her, ""Oh, hey""
You ain't never seen pastry dough (Yeah)
Tell lil' bitch, I got cake (Ayy)
Gettin' money, I'm the man
Gettin' money, had to count the advance
Saint Laurent all on my shoes, these not Vans
Need a fan in case a nigga get hot
'Member she ain't want me back, I was popped
On the block back before I had locks
Red dot for a chicken, he popped
MC, told the bitch, ""eat my cock""

Yeah, yeah, that's it"
275,Soldier,Damien,"[Verse 1]
What have I done to feel these fists from heaven?
I have to question
Have I done wrong?
What's with this reaction?
Am I a mad man?
If I walked on water would I sink or drown?
I think I'm lost, could I ever be found?
If I held your Bible will my soul set fire?
When that dark day comes will I be up by your side?

[Chorus]
Oh, when this world comes crashing down
I'll be, I'll be the soldier, I'll be the soldier
Oh, when this place falls to the ground
I'll be, I'll be the soldier, I'll be the soldier

[Bridge]
I guess it's you, hey, I guess it's you
That makes me be the bad one
That makes me be the mad one
I guess it's you, hey, I guess it's you
That puts these thoughts inside me
It's like you wanna hide me
Ooh yeah, I guess it's you

Am I a mad man?

278,Hold Up,Beyonce,"[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

When I run out of road, you bring me home

280,Ye vs The People,Kanye West Featuring T.I.,"[Kanye]
Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

[T.I.]
I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

[Kanye]
You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

[T.I.]
Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

[Kanye]
If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like ""oh I can wear this hat too""
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

[T.I.]
I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

[Kanye]
I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

[T.I.]
What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

[Kanye]
Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

[Kanye, to someone else in the room]
Did you play that umm, the one that said
""Tell Daddy what you learned in school""
(You wanna play with that, boy?)
I wanna play with that, yeah
(Alright, okay)

[Kanye, on a playback of ""Ye Vs The People""]
""I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it ""loc""
Successful man, a man that [?] the [?]
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them""

[Kanye]
You could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that

[T.I]
Sure

[Kanye]
You know what I'm saying?
And your shit come in, you say
""Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?
How could that be?
[murmurs]""
You know what I'm saying?
The exact conversation we're having
And what would you say?

[T.I.]
Sure
""Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this
Some things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against""
That would kinda [gestures], you know

[T.I., in recording studio]
Let me hear it bro, let me see what we got here

[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]

[T.I., recording]
""... you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down""

[Kanye, recording]
""... know everybody emotional
""Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?
Because it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?""

Or uhh, I could fuck your bitch

[T.I., recording]
""Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views
Of people who done made greater contributions than you""

[Kanye, on a playback of ""Ye Vs The People""]
""I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, I felt like I could be president"""

284,Weston Road Flows,Drake,"[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

[Outro]
Yeah, that's right, yeah"

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, ""It's okay.""

This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, ""It's okay.""

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it's okay
She said, ""It's okay."""
286,The Cut Off,J. Cole Featuring kiLL edward,"[Intro: kiLL edward]
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Yeah

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily ""Why you not with me?""
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]
Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Bridge: kiLL edward]
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]
Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know"

288,Babe,Sugarland Featuring Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1: Sugarland]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Verse 2: Sugarland]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Sugarland]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, ""No one else"", how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

[Bridge: Sugarland]
Since you admitted it, I keep picturin'
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe"
289,Life Is Worth Living,Justin Bieber,"[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

[Bridge]
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

[Verse 1]
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil
Gave her my heart, but she wanted my soul
She tasted the break and I can’t get more

[Chorus]
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

[Verse 2]
Alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door, oh no
Wasted again, but I can’t say no, whoa

[Refrain]
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

[Chorus]
You got me in chains (Oh baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)

Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

292,Xanny,Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning"

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference

Free everybody in the chain gang
It's been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Mr. T, them rings on, say my fucking name, ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fo'
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla

Nigga I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, ""Why you got so many condoms with you?""
I say, ""I'm a player, to be honest with you""
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them

[Chorus]
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better

Ain't no love without us
It will die
Roses turn into dust
Every night
We gettin' more popular
Wrong is right
When it comes to us

Oh, let's not be alone

Jetzt hält nichts für immer, nein
In der einen Minute bist du hier, in der Anderen bist du verschwunden
Also respektiere ich dich, will es langsam angehen
Ich brauche eine mentale Rechnung, um diesen Moment überhaupt zu kennen

[Pre-Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
Stört es dich, wenn ich einen Kuss klaue? (Chop, chop)
Ein kleines Souvenir, kann ich es dir klauen?
Um die Art, wie du mich schockierst, zu speichern
Die Art, wie du es hierher bewegst (Hey)
Möchte es einfach von dir fühlen (Hey)

[Refrain: Katy Perry]
Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Hey)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast (Hey)
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln
Gefühle mit mir

[Strophe 2: Pharrell Williams]
Ich bin dein Schaufensterkäufer, ein Abhängiger von deiner Liebe
Schalte von deiner Brille ab, virtuelle (virtuelle) Realität
Es ist nicht, was es dir kostet, es kann ein Dollar sein
Solange es dich schockt, Erinnerung, Elektrizität

[Pre-Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
Stört es dich, wenn ich einen Kuss klaue? (Chop, chop)
Ein kleines Souvenir, kann ich es dir klauen? (Oh, yeah)

Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast (Hey)
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln (Ungelogen)
Gefühle mit mir (Woah)

[Strophe 3: Big Sean]
Gottverdammt, ich weiß, dass du es liebst einen großen Auftritt hinzulegen
Magst du es bezahlt zu werden oder bezahlte Aufmerksamkeit zu bekommen?
Du hast die falschen Typen mit den richtigen Absichten vertan
Im gleichen Bett, doch es fühlt sich immer noch fern an
Sie sucht nach ein bisschen mehr Beständigkeit
Aber wenn du aufhörst zu suchen, wirst du finden, was sein soll
Und ehrlich gesagt, ich bin viel zu fertig mit Schlampen
Ich schoss meine Exen für deine x und o in die Wüste
Ich hab das Gefühl, dass meine alten Affären mich einfach vorbereitet haben
Wenn ich sage, dass ich dich will, sag es zurück, Parakeet
Flieg in der ersten Klasse durch die Luft, Airbnb
Ich bin der Beste, den du hattest, du würdest mich nur mit mir vergleichen
Ich „at” das an dich, wenn ich dich in meinem Handy speicher
Und lade es hoch, es wird die maximalen Aufrufzahlen bekommen
Ich kam duch das Loch mit den Lippenstiften und Handys rein
Trage dein Lieblingsperfüm, nur um dich alleine zu bekommen

[Refrain: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln
Hab keine Angst, diese Gefühle zu entwickeln
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Yeah)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast (Ich weiß)
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln
Woah, woah, woah
Gefühle mit mir

[Outro: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Hab keine Angst, Gefühle zu entwickeln (Nein, nein)
Hab keine Angst, Baby
Fahr mit offenen Dach und jag Nervenkitzel (Woah, okay)
Ich weiß, dass du hiervor keine Angst hast
Ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß, ich weiß
Baby, ich weiß, dass du keine Angst hast Gefühle zu entwickeln

313,It Don't Hurt Like It Used To,Billy Currington,"[Verse 1]
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

[Verse 2]
​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?
​Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​
[Verse 3]
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?

315,Keep The Family Close,Drake,"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)

You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that

Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

I'm in love

Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
""Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made""
You know what he'd say? ""You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit,"" hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say ""No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

About something but now, but now

Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
""What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

[Verse 2]
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around"

Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hopping

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade

There's demons closing in on every side, ooh

All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed"

No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I had some shoes
On my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold
In these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
Yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
I hear you over there
On your tailgate whistlin' [whistle]
Sayin' ""hey, girl""
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't ""pretty little thing""
""Hottie"" or ""baby""
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy
Being the

Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Verse 2]
Well, shakin' my moneymaker
Ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you
In this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time
""You gotta get you some of that""
Sure, I'll slide on over
But you're gonna get slapped
Ha, these days, it ain't easy bein' that

Girl in a country song

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

If he will be, if he will be here

Oh, woah

Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year

Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

I'ma ball hard like it's Super Bowl Sunday
A fool with the chewing, she chewing the D
What in the hell is she doing to me?
SWV got me weak in the knees
Give her the trophy, the throat of the week
Gucci the GOAT, got my foot on a throat
And my feet on the wood like I play in the league
Criss-crossing the country like crossing the skreet
And I feel like the Pope, all these crosses on me
If you still selling dope then I'm giving you hope
'Cause ain't none of them getting more money than me
I'ma keep giving them something to see
Honestly, none of them fucking with me
(It's Gucci!)

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga please, you ain't got as much guap as me
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch

I'm a motherfucking player, my nigga (player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her my nigga, yeah

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Nah, that ain't nothing to me
Boy, I get money in my sleep
Buy a new car every week
Get a new bitch everyday, ayy
Fuck what you heard, fuck what you say
Send them hitters where you stay
You don't wanna go shooter for shooter
You don't wanna go million for million
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
I got bitches in Hawaii (yeah)
I got bitches down in Houston
Some millionaires and some boosting
Might call your bitch to make a movie
And you know it's X rated
Like you know my weed strong
And this Sprite I'm drinking medicated
Break out the dice, let's shoot (let's shoot)
I'm selfish, I only buy coupes (coupes)
Told a bitch to bring one friend
Hardheaded ass bitch brought two
Look one of them in the eye, said
""I already fucked you, why she brought you?""
I'm a player, these bitches, they love me
In the club passing out bubbly (just take that)
Bitch, I'm the shit like Ruffin (David)
Can't a nigga tell me nothing (it's Dolph)
I'm out in Hollywood drugging (drugging)
Young nigga paid and thugging (yeah)

How can love just disappear?
And where does it go when it's over?
I know that it's somewhere out here

If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

It's late, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight
Baby, I'm chasing my shadow around
Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets
I can't change what I've become
There's pain and there's glory, but this is my story
I'm asking everyone
Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be

Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?

We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, count fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glizzy
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy

Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets
And all she want is the D
And for me to keep this ice on me

Let's stop for a while, have recess

Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle

[Chorus]
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love , have rich sex (yeah, yeah)

353,Medicine,Queen Naija,"[Verse 1]
You tell me you love me
But I ain't been feeling it lately
You say you love keeping me fly but
Can't keep me from looking' so crazy
Come in at 6 in the mornin'
Where you been, where you been?
Who is that texting your phone?
Just a friend, just a friend (okay)
My intuition never lies
There's nothing you can ever hide
Already got the screenshots
So there is no need to deny
You been creepin' and freakin' and sneakin'
Like you'll never lose me
Steady claiming that everyone know we together
But you steady choosing

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
But that ain't been keeping us stable
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine (hey, yeah)

[Chorus]
How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo and, I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

[Verse 2]
You don't like it
Now you telling' me that I should fight it
Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'
Why dish it out but can't take it
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him
Now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
How could you play me when the love I gave was real
I even took you back and you still had no chill

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you ain't gone ever learn
Play with fire you get burned
I don't think you'll understand
Until I hit you where it hurts
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine

[Chorus]
How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo, and I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

[Outro]
All of those tears I cried
I can't count the lonely nights
Time and time again I've tried
So when I turn into a savage, boy, don't ask me why
Ask me why, don't ask me why, yeah
Give you a taste of your own medicine"

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

356,Drunk Girl,Chris Janson,"[Verse 1]
Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home

[Chorus 2]
You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home"

Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

[Verse 2]
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

363,Down That Road,Alisan Porter,"[Verse 1]
If you wanna give up, take a chance
When the party’s over, you should have the last dance
If there's no direction and you can’t see
Let your heart draw a map in the stars and go where it leads

[Chorus]
Cause I can give you hope
But I can’t show you how
Only you can turn the light on
Find your way back out
It may be dark and winding
But it leads you home
I know, yes, I know

[Verse 2]
There’s no shame, love, in falling apart
Nothing comes easy but it won’t always be
No, it won’t be always be so hard

Oooh, oooh, oooh

Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oh oh oh oh

Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives

[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know

[Verse 2]
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
Naw they don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way

[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Bridge]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

So now I curse that raven's fire
You made me hate, you made me burn
He laughed aloud as he flew from Eden
You always knew, you never learn

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human track
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king"
375,Hard Times,Paramore,"[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it’s alright
For me to come out

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive

And I gotta get to rock bottom (Oof!)

Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain’t coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I’ll come alive

(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

376,Blessings,Chance The Rapper Featuring Ty Dolla $ign,"[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (Coming, coming, coming)
So are you ready?
Are you ready?

377,Window Pain (Outro),J. Cole,"[Intro]
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world

Glee

[Verse]
I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

[Outro]
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'

388,Get Up 10,Cardi B,"[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (say it)
Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast, mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (fucked up)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (woo)
I walked into the label, ""Where the check at?"" (where the check?)
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that ""blap"" sound (blap!)

[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it.""
She replied: ""Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life.""

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Everything hot like it's fresh off the grill
Million dollar grill look fresh on the hill
Plus I'm 6'5"", she need to step in some heels
'Fore she step up in here you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors (four doors)
From the corner store to the corridor (corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo
(I'm burnin' up)
Roof on fire, we can burn up
Turn down for what, nigga turn up
Motherfucker must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat
(I'm burnin' up)
Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford, wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore

[Pre-Outro: Jessie J]
I'm burnin' up, up, up...
Walkin' through the fire, please don't let me go (I'm burnin' up, up, up...)
Take me to the river, I need you to know

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I'm burnin'
I'm burnin'
I'm burnin'
I'm burnin' up, up, up...

[Chorus: Jessie J]
Come put me out

Come put me out

It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense

No, It don't make sense

That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Turned 7 to a 14, 14 to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game, switched up on you hoes, mayne
Big body take both lanes, backseat blowin' propane
All black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own mayne
My new shit sound like it's ""Soul Train""
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we fo' sho bang
Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

Who knew? Who knew?

I'd break you up, you just let me down

Got my All Money In chain too
Let me down

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk I'ma shine
Might a been way before its time
Posted wit my back against the wall
Life is a bitch but she mine
The rag six deuce yeah it's mine
""The Westside II"", yeah it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall like the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendleton's
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut

Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us

404,When I Was Your Man,Chris Jamison,"[Round 1: Arcane]
I said, I was ready to put a stack up
But he had to ask his dad, he needed some backup
Told me his dad wanted to talk to me on the phone and make sure everything add up
I said that shit is sad Charron
You want me to talk to your dad on the phone
When are you gonna lose the chaperone and be a fucking man of your own?
When I was 17 I hustled blocks, had a couple spots
Pounds to my crew
But I never would've rapped outside my bedroom if I sounded like you
When I was 17 I could spit rhymes and freestyle hard
This kid can't even rap and y'all treat him like he's some kind of child star
Well I'ma make him die slow, like poorly prescribed drugs
Or I can make your life short like a .45 snub
Cause little Corey's rhymes suck, so keep your corny lines tucked
Cause we already know how child stars named Corey wind up
But you ain't no Corey Haim
This corny lame is such a groupie I should slap dude
He prolly ain't never even heard of Lost Boys/Boyz, the movie or the rap group
Yo, think about it, think about it
It's been 13 years since Biggie died
And back when that shit happened little Corey wasn't even five
So, now this little fucking preteen virgin soul hurting
His idea of a musical legend is Bo Burnham
Well since you need a history lesson, I'm gon' learn him
After I light up this little glow worm it's closed curtains
See I go hard for the 905, I stay repping that Hammer City
I laugh when you do like this with your hands
That's the same way I be milking your grandma's titties
Mothafucka, I'm a graveyard yet, you ain't even on my radar yet
So I'ma put Charron to sleep in a box, race car bed

[Round 1: Charron]
Yo listen
You said might milking my grandma's titties, well my flowing's legit
You talking about my grandma, well you're older than her bitch
Listen, you brought up Bo Burnham, well he's my boy
That motherfucker is evil
When you heard his song Klu Klux Klan Cookout you're like, ""He said what about my people?""
""You are not black!"" Was always said by his mother
""Arcane, you can't say that word. You're not a brother.""
Now look at you today you stupid fucker
That advice was like the bullet that killed Kurt Cobain
It went in one ear and out the other
Arcane, I met your friends Winston and Ted and that's Ted too
Arcane, you don't have any black friends dude
So where the fuck did you get that accent through?
Yo, he actually thinks he's black, this guy is a wigger
Stop eating Tootsie Rolls with a spork, you won't bite off your fingers
Go ahead and mention I'm young
No one's impressed with this evident scum
You're in your mid thirties and you dress like a thug
You're about as real as the ID I used to get in this club
Someone older than Psycho is something we haven't seen before
I've battled a Korean, you battled in the Korean War
See I should be getting a girlfriend, you should be getting a wife
16 years ago I was in diapers
In 16 years you'll be in diapers for the rest of your life
And your long ass introduction for Knamelis
Organik should've said your time was up
Ironically your intro didn't end til' 3:14, that's pi as fuck!

[Round 2: Arcane]
Son, I run my city like my name was Pops Papalia
I got an Ikea coffee table covered in pot paraphernalia
Since you said I'm 40 son I hope you're not scared of a failure
That means I'm 80 proof, my shit'll put hair on your genitalia
And you can say I'm washed up but I don't really think that's clever cause
Truth is I'm a veteran and you 'bout to be a has been who never was
You went 4 and 0 against bums, but you ain't never battled a vet
So it's time this little overrated faggot got a reality check
Listen, you battled Sandman, JWalker, Lokust and O.Z
So I guess you proved you can hang with the lost tier MC in the whole league
I beat cats like Knamelis, Scandalous, some real fucking OG's
This kid get excused from gym class cause his bitch ass is prone to nose bleeds
Now I know Ottawa got some real MC's
Osa and Bender both grizzly
So how you trying to go international in Grind Time? You ain't even the best in your own city
I heard you ducking Roosevelt cause you in the same age bracket
Okay faggot, you battle in New York with those arms flapping he'd put you in a straight jacket
Now, I understand this, you use those rebuttals as a gimmick
To me that shit's transparent
So everybody look it's King Of The Dot's kid with the flips
This little bitch named Sharon
Well you the type that should never try to rap outside your parent's home
So it's my Basic Instinct to put an ice pick through Sharon's Stone(s)
Now, if this was URL, I'd have to blare the fog horn
Last I seen you, you could barely handle O.Z., it's Sharon Osbourne
Listen, you got molested by Knamelis and Pat Stay
But you were scared of holding his hand
Y'all on some down low Three's Company shit
Sharon, Lois and Bram
First you was Pat Stay's bitch, you call him your ""sugar daddy""
But then when he pimped yo' ass out to Knamelis I guess you took it badly
So I'ma slaughter this geek and please don't bother to speak
You still got a piece of Knamelis pubic hair caught in your teeth
Bitch!

[Round 2: Charron]
Pat Stay wants to rape me, those are the freshest schemes
If Pat Stay was here he'd knock this sucker out for wearing EXCO jeans
You are not black
An intervention was held by his family at his place in the fall
""Alex, you're 30 working at Ikea where they're paying you small
On your breaks you go and hang out with your gang at the mall
And for God will you stop telling people your middle name is 'Jamal'?""
If you're the baddest guy from Hamilton your town is to send
My dad wants the rest of my Cub Scout meetings held there for 2010
And you're from Hamilton? Well I'm a city slayer
After I murder you, your crew and your city mayor
R.I.P. Hamilton, like that Piston's player
When it comes to King Of The Dot, your sister's the biggest groupie
She gave the whole town dome like the plot for the Simpson's movie

[Arcane]
Watch your fucking mouth son!

[Charron]
(Damn. What are you talking about?)
When it comes to girls I'm like GSP
I dominate from the top cause they're out of breath and they're gasping
With girls you're like Dan Hardy cause you'll never end up tapping
See I'm skinny and smart, love pictures of art and I'm sick at guitar
I realize people pick me apart cause they don't think that I'm hard
But Knamelis told me in high school you were picked on and scarred
You were gifted and smart with riveting marks
And ate lunch in the library with the kids that were really bizarre
So I realize I'm a nerd and I just live with the card
So you're battling the person you're afraid to admit that you are

[Round 3: Arcane]
I said yo, son
If all you gon' be spitting, is rehearsed writtens
I hope he brought more than that last weak verse with him
I swear to God you can bring a team of researchers with him
This dude can't even fucking find a t-shirt that fits him
Yo, and you can keep calling me a wigger
But you saying you taking his cash, its like you saying you clapping triggers
Son, you ain't stacking figures, you still playing with action figures
Quit bringing the same lame ass crackers with ya
Cause all of y'all seem like a bunch of rejects from ya high school volleyball team
But yo listen
I know I'm that dude that everybody loves to hate
Yeah, I choked and still won, gave y'all something to debate
Then I came back to clean up ya big brother Jake
So after this, you can tell Pesci I'm coming for the cake
You ain't hip hop ya fake, now you done pissed off at Drake
Antawn Jamison, I might just Chris Bosh ya face
See, cause everything I touch is ether
I should put you in a fucking freezer
You be almost like just like Justin Bieber but you never touched a beaver
Yo, and you ain't never hustled neither
So I don't know what this little guy about
But this some grown man business
I'ma have to put this little kid on timeout

[Round 3: Charron]
Yo, I came to spit flames, I'm here to bust the ether
You compare me to Justin Bieber?
But you have so many ugly features
It looks like as a kid you were beat more than Russell Peters
Yo, and you talk like, ""Yo, I'm Chris Bosh"" basketball when you're making a rhyme
Well I fucked your girl she's the craziest dime
I left her legs more spread open than Lebron James when he's taking a stride
Listen, and you said I stayed at Knamelis's house the last battle you rapped in
Well the night before I stayed at your house I'll tell the people what actually happened
I showed up to his house in a red shirt, he was puzzled and confused
Like, ""Corey, this is Hamilton! You can't wear that the Crips are coming over soon.""
I watched you post up at Zellers from 12:00 to 6:00
With your arms crossed like that and foot on the wall like this
At your house I met your twin brother Mike
I said, ""Wow, you guys are identical, you look exactly alike.""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck do you mean we look exactly alike?""
[?] wrapping salad for supper and rolled out the futon
As soon as you took a bite of it you choked on the croutons
I said, ""Can I get you something to drink? Perhaps a cup of juice?""
He said, ""Man, what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink baby. Hmmm. Spurt and stuff.""
It was bedtime and he said, ""Boy, you ain't dressed like a rapper.""
He brought me some 2Pac underwear and Exco pajamas
There was no blankets I was cold up on Arcane's sofa
He said, ""Don't use the sheets on my windows. Here's one of my Scarface posters.""
I looked at your Get Rich Or Die Trying wallpaper as I laid on your couch
And said, ""Fuck. This. Shit. I'm going to Knamelis' house.""
Just look at you, Jesus fucking Christ
You're 32 and wearing Exco...you suck at life"

Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way

Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17

Now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"
406,I'm Sorry,Adam Wakefield,"Church

        ""HETTY, Hetty, don't you know church begins at two, and it's gone half after one a'ready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him drownded i' th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold, but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid of a funeral?""

        ""Well, Aunt,"" said Hetty, ""I can't be ready so soon as everybody else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work to make her stand still.""

        Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on.

        And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, ""Come, Hetty—come, little uns!"" and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard.

        The ""little uns"" addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon.

        You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an excellent spring-bed on his mother's fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind. ""Church! Nay—I'n gotten summat else to think on,"" was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and ""Whissuntide."" But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure.

        ""There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,"" said Martin Poyser. ""I reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he has, and him turned seventy-five.""

        ""Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,"" said Mrs. Poyser; ""they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're looking at. It's God A'mighty's way o' quietening 'em, I reckon, afore they go to sleep.""

        Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching, and held it wide open, leaning on his stick—pleased to do this bit of work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he was still useful—that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing—and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead.

        ""They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the churchyard,"" he said, as his son came up. ""It 'ud ha' been better luck if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin'; there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a boat there, dost see? That's a sure sign o' fair weather—there's a many as is false but that's sure.""

        ""Aye, aye,"" said the son, ""I'm in hopes it'll hold up now.""

        ""Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,"" said Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling, a little, secretly, during the sermon.

        ""Dood-bye, Dandad,"" said Totty. ""Me doin' to church. Me dot my neklace on. Dive me a peppermint.""

        Grandad, shaking with laughter at this ""deep little wench,"" slowly transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.

        And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path.

        There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its mother's flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their ""keep""—an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects.

        ""There's that shorthorned Sally,"" she said, as they entered the Home Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye. ""I begin to hate the sight o' the cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.""

        ""Why, thee't not like the women in general,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's Chowne's wife wants him to buy no other sort.""

        ""What's it sinnify what Chowne's wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi' no more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house again—all hugger-mugger—and you'd niver know, when you went in, whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i' their boots.""

        ""Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if thee lik'st,"" said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns. ""Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,"" Mrs. Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled on in front of her father and mother. ""There's shapes! An' she's got such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child.""

        ""Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's got THY coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i' my family; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty's.""

        ""The child 'ull be none the worse for having summat as isn't like Hetty. An' I'm none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter o' that, there's people wi' light hair an' blue eyes as pretty as them wi' black. If Dinah had got a bit o' colour in her cheeks, an' didn't stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows, folks 'ud think her as pretty as Hetty.""

        ""Nay, nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, ""thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.""

        ""What care I what the men 'ud run after? It's well seen what choice the most of 'em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o' wives you see, like bits o' gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour's gone.""

        ""Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee,"" said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; ""and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.""

        ""I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself'; 'but,' I said, 'if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it's little enough you'd do for him. You'd be thinking he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.' Eh, I wonder where she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she'd set her heart on going to all of a sudden.""

        ""Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might ha' stayed wi' us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it 'ud niver ha' been missed. She made no odds in th' house at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant.""

        ""It's no use thinking o' that,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""You might as well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an' live here comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, I should ha' turned her, for I've talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her too; for she's my own sister's child, and it behoves me to do what I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she'd said us 'good-bye' an' got into the cart, an' looked back at me with her pale face, as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be frightened to think o' the set-downs I'd given her; for it comes over you sometimes as if she'd a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks have. But I'll niver give in as that's cause she's a Methodist, no more nor a white calf's white cause it eats out o' the same bucket wi' a black un.""

        ""Nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his good-nature would allow; ""I'm no opinion o' the Methodists. It's on'y tradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi' them maggots. There's maybe a workman now an' then, as isn't overclever at's work, takes to preachin' an' that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as has got one o' the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he's a good Churchman, else I'd never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty.""

        ""Why, goodness me,"" said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was speaking, ""look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. How COULD you let 'em do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you. Run back and tell 'em to come on.""

        Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency, ""Dey naughty, naughty boys—me dood.""

        The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said ""Lawks!"" whenever she was expected to wonder.

        Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting, ""We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!"" with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.

        ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise, ""that's a good lad; why, where is it?""

        ""Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking after the greenfinch, and she sat on th' nest.""

        ""You didn't frighten her, I hope,"" said the mother, ""else she'll forsake it.""

        ""No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly—didn't I, Molly?""

        ""Well, well, now come on,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""and walk before Father and Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go straight on now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday.""

        ""But, Mother,"" said Marty, ""you said you'd give half-a-crown to find the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my money-box?""

        ""We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.""

        The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a cloud.

        ""Mother,"" he said, half-crying, ""Marty's got ever so much more money in his box nor I've got in mine.""

        ""Munny, me want half-a-toun in my bots,"" said Totty.

        ""Hush, hush, hush,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""did ever anybody hear such naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if they don't make haste and go on to church.""

        This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias ""bullheads,"" which the lads looked at wistfully.

        The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen ""sweltered"" while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.

        ""It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so,"" he observed, as they passed through the ""Big Meadow."" ""But it's poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience. There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,' used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An' what's he come to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi' oranges in't.""

        ""Ah, to be sure,"" said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, ""you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi' wickedness. The money as is got so's like to burn holes i' your pocket. I'd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i' the rightful way. And as for the weather, there's One above makes it, and we must put up wi't: it's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.""

        Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit which Mrs. Poyser's clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position—that nothing else can be expected of them.

        It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable—about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see her—about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman, and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance—what could they do in church if they were there before service began?—and they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about ""bus'ness.""

        Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude—that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.

        They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a ""burial,"" and in Mr. Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners.

        The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.

        But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must now enter and take his place.

        I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews—great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand.

        But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation—on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books—why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few ""good words"" by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing up—the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too—all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.

        I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.

        I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances—she was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne—he always came first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn't mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies—no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now—she might be mistaken—for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancel—there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty's nostrils. ""It donna smell,"" she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done—it roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know.

        What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn ""Absolution"" in her deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur's absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain—she would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.

        But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours.

        But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdom—a reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk—a man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his intervals as a bird.

        Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death—not in his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant—and now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words—

                                Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;
                                We vanish hence like dreams—

        seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's hand before their parting, and say, ""Father, you know it was all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!"" Adam thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death!

        ""Ah! I was always too hard,"" Adam said to himself. ""It's a sore fault in me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive 'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there's no knowing—perhaps nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.""

        This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had perpetually returned since his father's death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, ""In the midst of life we are in death""—how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truths—but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?

        Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, ""The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,"" seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest—it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.

        Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.

        ""Well, Mrs. Bede,"" said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, ""you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey.""

        ""Aye, aye,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""they wonna have long to wait for one another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i' th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now.""

        ""Eh,"" said Lisbeth, ""it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the better. I'm no good to nobody now.""

        Adam never took notice of his mother's little unjust plaints; but Seth said, ""Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never get another mother.""

        ""That's true, lad, that's true,"" said Mr. Poyser; ""and it's wrong on us to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children cryin' when the fathers and mothers take things from 'em. There's One above knows better nor us.""

        ""Ah,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""an' it's poor work allays settin' the dead above the livin'. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon—it 'ud be better if folks 'ud make much on us beforehand, i'stid o' beginnin' when we're gone. It's but little good you'll do a-watering the last year's crop.""

        ""Well, Adam,"" said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife's words were, as usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to change the subject, ""you'll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it's got broke, and it'll be a nice job to mend it—there'll want a bit o' turning. You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?""

        Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long name—a Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving information.

        Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding—it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that the ""lass was well enough,"" and that ""a man might do worse""; but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.

        Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who ""knew his business"" and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her husband, ""You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to hear him crow."" For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not his ""bringing up""; for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.

        ""Well, Mr. Poyser,"" he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak, ""ye'll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I'm thinking. The glass sticks at 'change,' and ye may rely upo' my word as we'll ha' more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue cloud there upo' the 'rizon—ye know what I mean by the 'rizon, where the land and sky seems to meet?""

        ""Aye, aye, I see the cloud,"" said Mr. Poyser, ""'rizon or no 'rizon. It's right o'er Mike Holdsworth's fallow, and a foul fallow it is.""

        ""Well, you mark my words, as that cloud 'ull spread o'er the sky pretty nigh as quick as you'd spread a tarpaulin over one o' your hay-ricks. It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds. Lord bless you! Th' met'orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there's a pretty sight o' things I could let THEM up to, if they'd just come to me. And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?—thinking o' getherin' the red currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better gether 'em afore they're o'erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?"" Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. ""I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're in trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the garden s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire could get as 'ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking whether he'd be willing I've got to run my calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure o' getting back the money as I pay the squire. I should like to see some o' them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as I've got to do every year as comes.""

        ""They look pretty fur, though,"" said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. ""Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi' the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an' th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's France, an' th' anchor's Nelson—an' they told us that beforehand.""

        ""Pee—ee-eh!"" said Mr. Craig. ""A man doesna want to see fur to know as th' English 'ull beat the French. Why, I know upo' good authority as it's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an' they live upo' spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o' the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why, it 'ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm's thicker nor a Frenchman's body, I'll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi' stays; and it's easy enough, for they've got nothing i' their insides.""

        ""Where IS the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?"" said Adam. ""I was talking to him o' Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.""

        ""Oh, he's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon he'll be back again afore many days are o'er, for he's to be at all th' arranging and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th o' July. But he's fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and th' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.""

        Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say ""good-bye."" The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had ""nothing to say again' him, on'y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o'er again, an' hatched different.""

        So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety—where Adam would never have to ask again as he entered, ""Where's Father?""

        And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm—all with quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have gone—he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night's vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the ""growing pain"" of passion."

[Ponte: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verso: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got twelve slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pré-Refrão: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Refrão: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, ""Resentment"" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'

I just wanna

[Verse 1]
It's in the air
The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare
Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there
With every hit I take, you move that waist and I wanna die
A girl like you, adore
The way you drop that thing could start another war
And my hands are gettin' eager to explore
Cherry lips are singin' ""Purple Rain"" and I feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I take the wheel and grab the clutch
Your body should be mine to touch
I fit the rhythm your body's givin'
And once I get in there

[Chorus]
She got the smoothest ride
Like velvet all inside
Her sex just changed my life
She rides like a dream
And damn that velvet looks good on me

[Verse 2]
I feel the heat
Every drop of you is rainin' down on me
You're perfection's foggin' up my window seat
I got your body switchin' all positions through the night

Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, ""How to make a milli'"" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you"

418,Ilomilo,Billie Eilish,"[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie"

420,Duckworth.,Kendrick Lamar,"[Intro: Bēkon & Kid Capri]
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

[Bridge: Ted Taylor (Sampled)]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
[Gunshot]

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Why second guess? I should have stayed

I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)

Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)

430,Writing's On The Wall,Sam Smith,"[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Bridge]
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall"

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down

Standing in the light of your halo

Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, ""Thanks for givin' to me,"" like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
""Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"" so I woke up with my wood hard

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense

435,Open Letter,Lil Wayne,"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where’d I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You’re a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me
That only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes
It's now or next
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin’, that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive""
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Refrain]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that"

Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal

Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run

I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it

So close I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it

440,Guts Over Fear,Eminem Featuring Sia,"[Pont : Eminem]
Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Couplet 1 : Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I’ve been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin’, it’s your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

[Refrain : Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Guts over fear, guts over fear

[Pont : Eminem]
Feels like a close, it’s coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Couplet 2 : Eminem]
It’s like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh
Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was... gone

[Refrain : Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn’t wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is here
Guts over fear, I shall not tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Guts over fear, guts over fear"

But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though

Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit

But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit

Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn’t even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30, he ate, all them getting off

Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot

Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind

I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""
Where you at? I never see you

Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys

Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause
Damn Young Gunna done growed up
Back to back the coupes, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us

From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called ""Make Me Disappear""

You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly
20s on me, I call 'em green relish
Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in

They still can't believe that I made it, they happy

No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city
I just keep puttin' this syrup in my kidneys
This the big one, boy, this not the Jubilee (Jubilee)
I got Gunna with me, rockin' VLONE, Supreme (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
No, I don't say it often
And I probably should’ve told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don’t wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone

[Chorus]
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Verse 2]
I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but here we go again
Girl, you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switching positions
You tell me, ""Shut up""
And you know I listen, I hate it
Wish I never did it
I can’t keep sinning and pretending (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm taking off your clothes
We getting sexual
Hit it so good, think I’ll propose
I don't know but

[Chorus]
I'm undecided, excited (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying (All these, all these)
But I’m still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

461,Alive,Sia,"[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I played on my own
I survived
Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Bridge]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it all, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)

463,Blue Notes,Meek Mill,"[Intro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and lonely
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even old niggas, they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there, my G

[Interlude: Meek Mill & Snowy White]
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact, take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself, nigga
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and lonely

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was shiesty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell

[Outro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and lonely"

If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'

I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button

Smokin' science lab

Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, ""Oooh, Lordy,"" smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, ""Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free""
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother

Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
When doves cry (when doves cry)
When doves cry (when doves cry)
When doves cry

Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first

[Verse 1: Future]
These bitches be naggin' the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep em' comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

[Hook: Future]
I did the digital dash

[Verse 2: Drake]
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don’t let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might gone fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple what I’m making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I

Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth

With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang
Chris Johnson, I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth (cool), he put a potato on a barrel
I kick her dumbass out my crib, say she want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor ass hoe a Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

[Verse 4: Future]
Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starving
Monisha, Tamica, they vouching
Before I had anything, I was saucing
Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucing
All these hitters, yeah, I pray you never cross them

[Verse 5: Kodak Black]
She say she pregnant, I swear I think I wanna off her
Eighteen hunded, I got more stories than a author
I'm credit card swipin' at the Chase Bank (ey)
Me and Future gang gang, same thang
I check your temperature, nigga, is you hot or cold?
Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash 4 gold
These streets made me lose my conscience, took a nigga soul

[Verse 6: Future]
These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they filling up they nose
I know my Levi got love for me
She just want everybody to know

[Verse 7: Kodak Black]
I know my niggas, they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care about how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money, then they switch lanes
I ran it back up, then I switch lanes
In a brand new Range, diamond colored candy cane
I bought a brand new K, I can't wait to let it spray
I'm sorry mom ain't mean to bring you through so much pain
I said I'm sorry mom, I ain't mean for it to be this way
Ayy but fuck it, bitch, I'm here, I got diamond rings
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid

[Outro: Kodak Black]
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid"

I always thought I'd be with someone else
I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah

Fuck these niggas man (run it)

Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'

But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 (hey!)
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup

Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you

Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you’re a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, ""T where you been?""
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra

It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, it hit so hard, I'm holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
Keep reminding me, oh, to forget your love

You left your burn (In my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn (In my heart)
You left your mark (I can’t understand)

There's no room in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core, still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I try to forget the memories

Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget

474,Fall,Eminem,"[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it, slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, ""he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)—Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo!)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch! (yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now

Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

[Chorus: Kehlani with Ty Dolla $ign]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up (Switch it up)
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Outro: Kehlani]
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl"
480,The Blower's Daughter,Matt McAndrew,
481,Gonna Wanna Tonight,Chase Rice,"If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you wanna then we're gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishin' dock
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

If you wanna catch a buzz and ride it til the mornin'
Let's get two plastic cups and baby I'll get to pourin'
I don't really matter if it's whiskey or wine, it's fine

If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

Gonna wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Come on
Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

Ya gonna wanna tonight"
482,We Are,Justin Bieber Featuring Nas,"[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Happy birthday

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 3: Nas]
She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are"

March to the rhythm of a different drum (Mmm, mm)

488,Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind,Logic,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself

[Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah"
489,I Walk The Line,Craig Wayne Boyd,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line"
490,Calling My Spirit,Kodak Black,"[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics

I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz

Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up

Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil

His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brra!)

Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby

We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)

I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Let's have a good, have a good time, yeah

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this
And you set me free
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired
Oh babe

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Jeffery!
Brand new chapter of a real you
She got every red bottom like a baboon
Hunnid' bottles in the club, real one room
Girl you gotta keep up with a boss move
King of the jungle, tycoon
Everybody thinking that's a cartoon
We just wanna party, way back in the war room
Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something
Shawty suck the dick good, she wanna fuck it first
Hey mista, you a rat burn
Good hair down her back
Rich nigga, I like 'em ratchet
Fuck it up, throw it back
No shave, Brazilian wax

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this

And you set me free, boy
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this

Hey, hey
I could sweat like this all night
Oh, heatstroke, oh
I think you opened my eyes"
500,Little Red Corvette,Prince,"[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""What have I got to lose?""

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""Baby, have you got enough gas?""
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Yes you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

[Chorus 2]
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

[Breakdown]
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!

[Chorus]
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

[Chorus 2]
Babe, you got too slow down (you got too slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)

Little red corvette!"

Nimm es oder lass es
Baby, nimm es oder lass es
Aber ich weiß, du wirst es nicht lassen
Weil ich weiß, dass du es brauchst
Guck in den Spiegel
Wenn ich in den Spiegel gucke
Baby, ich sehe es klarer
Warum du mir näher kommen willst

[Pre-Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Ich bin nicht überrascht
Ich fühle mit, ah
Ich kann nicht bestreiten
Deinen Appetit, ah

[Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben

[Strophe 2: Selena Gomez]
Kommst an dein Limit
Sagst du kommst an dein Limit
Gehst über dein Limit
Aber ich weiß, du kannst damit nicht aufhören
Etwas an mir
Macht dich süchtig nach meinem Körper
Nimmt dich über und unter und verdreht wie Origami

[Pre-Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Ich bin nicht überrascht
Ich fühle mit, ah
Ich kann nicht bestreiten
Deinen Appetit, ah

[Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder

Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben

[Strophe 3: Gucci Mane]
*Es ist Gucci!*
Die Art wie du läufst, die Art wie du redest
Ich werfe es dir vor, denn es ist alles deine Schuld
Du spielst hart, turn mich nicht ab
Du spielst hart, aber ich weiß, du bist weich
Du bist mein Fetisch, ich bin voll dabei
All diese Gerüchte, die verbreitet werden
Könnte es genau so gut machen und einfach kommen
Weil sie sagen, wir hätten es schon getan
Wende dich an Gucci, wenn du mich jemals brauchst
Ich werde am South Beach im glänzenden Cabrio sein
Wasser Diamanten, Aquafina
Brauche dich nur im blauen Bikini

[Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe"

*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us."" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Oooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fuckin' industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date.""  ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" No, it's not, it's a peach!
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eatin' a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
504,Life Changes,Thomas Rhett,"[Verse 1]
Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 3]
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no"
505,True Colors,Zedd & Kesha,"[Verse 1: Kesha]
Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow

[Verse 2: Kesha]
A promise with a lie is broken by design
And what I thought I knew has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow

[Bridge: Kesha]
Something tells me I know nothing at all
I've escaped my capture and I have no master
And somehow it's like I've waited

[Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow
It ain't your rainbow, it ain't your rainbow
It ain't your rainbow"

Un paio di piloti ribelli
Stanno volando ma non devono essere da nessuna parte
Non ti conosco molto bene
Ma penso che potremmo essere simili
Ci comportiamo in modo anomalo

[Pre-Ritornello: Lorde]
Lasciamo che le cose escano dalla falegnameria
Ti mostrerò il mio lato migliore, ti dirò le mie migliori bugie
Si, fantastico, vero?
Allora lasciamo che le cose escano dalla falegnameria
Ti mostrerò il mio lato migliore, ti dirò le mie migliori bugie
Mi vedi rotolare, amare qualcun altro
Balliamo senza le scarpe
Sai che penso che tu sia fantastico, vero?

[Ritornello: Lorde]
Le nostre regole, i nostri sogni, siamo ciechi
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa
I nostri amici, i nostri drink, ci ispiriamo
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa

[Strofa Due: Khalid]
Voglio sentire la luce, spingiamo i nostri limiti
Slacciato per la corsa, mhmm
Siamo lontano di casa
Siamo onesti con noi stessi
Siamo troppo in alto per guidare
Prendiamoci la notte
Se la luce è nel cielo
Aperto, finalmente, andiamo e siamo liberi

[Ritornello: Khalid & Lorde]

Ho fermato la tua ragazza alla porta
Ho detto al tuo amico di andare al negozio
È solo io e te, finalmente noi due
Non mi pento di aver bevuto questo liquore, ti faccio ascoltare
Si, so che non mi conosci bene

Ho lasciato la mia cautela a casa
Non torno indietro

Camminiamo, non cadiamo mai, ma corriamo ancora
Allora, versi, versi un'altra bibita
So che stiamo facendo qualcosa
Abbiamo, abbiamo una pistola carica
Vai e mostrami lo sguardo nei tuoi occhi
Sei qui, sono tuo, tu sei mio
Ci troviamo quando siamo pazzi
Poi ci prendiamo tutto
Sei un treno in corsa, si
Mi fai sentire alto
Non voglio inseguirlo, no

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said ""Whatever"" 'cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promotin', she hostin'
She posin', legs open, provokin'
It got my head smokin'
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

[Hook: Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne)]
I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

[Bridge : Charlie Puth]
I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

[Hook: Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne)]
I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know her Lord)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble"

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"
512,Get Used To It,Justin Bieber,"[Verse 1]
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

[Pre-Chorus]
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

All day
Get used to me falling through

Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve

513,The One,The Chainsmokers,"[Verse 1]
You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds

[Chorus]
Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

[Verse 2]
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

[Chorus]
Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

Question is, do they believe you?

Give mama a hug, we finally made it
We puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady
Business is business, so you gotta pay me

Uh, Bentleys on Bentleys, we mob through the A
Benjis on Benjis, we stack every day
Business is business, so you gotta pay
New Lamborghinis make me wanna race
Still eat fettuccine I'm stuck in my ways
My bed Tempur-Pedic, I fuckin' get paid
My flow a disease, kill these rappers like AIDS
Yves St. Laurent on the lens of my shades
Gunna back up, I was goin' through a phase
I doubled up and got my bitches straight
You learned how to drip from you watchin' my page
Niggas be tossin', somebody decay
Off-White'd the coupe and the inside is beige
I pop this shit like I've been doin' for ages
So many dead faces I got me a grave
YSL, nigga say ""Slatt"" every day
I pop me a pill, one got stuck in my throat
This Rollie a Presi', I don't need to vote
Your ho super ready, she at my condo

Bouncin' my life, got my back off the rope
Too real I can't turn my back on the bros

You dropped the ball I got it, we winnin'
Spaceship for a car that ain't rented
They know who I am, I ain't walkin' through Lenox
It didn't take long, I ran up them racks
Bought it, ain't like it, ain't takin it back
I shoulda playin' linebacker, I want a sack
I got this cheetah print all on my jacket
I got the belt and the shoes to match it
I'm from the hood, I'm keepin' my ratchet
My bitch the baddest, she ain't bougie, she ratchet
I get him flipped, then I buy him a casket
I'm servin' real, I ain't just singin', rappin'
I got on Soldier Re's, they're classics
I got a 31 doin' gymnastics
I sold a brick, it was still in the package
Sixty five hundred was spent on this coat
(Got a bitch in the condo, she snortin' the coke)
I don't wanna fuck her just want the throat
I'm savin' my money, I ain't goin' broke
Don't want no handouts, that shit ain't no joke

517,Phenomenal,Eminem,"[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal"

Our own way
At my place, far away

You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I get you touchin' on your body
I get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Verse 2]
Baby you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy' cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Verse 3]
Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real,) yeah
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me (the fast life keeps gaining on me,) shit
But ever since I met you (ever since I met you)
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe
(Woooooh)

[Chorus]
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body (touchin' on your body)
I got you touchin' on your body (touchin' on your body)
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Outro]
I'm not tryna talk at all
Tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous"
528,Demon,Lil Wayne,"[Verse 1]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

[Chorus]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man, you
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, ""Can we dance?""
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Bridge 2]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

[Chorus 2]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

[Verse 2]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge 3]
A demon, with demands
A demon, with demands

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, ""Can we dance?""
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Outro]
Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
Demon with demands, demon with demands"

And now you never call back, please
Girl, girl, what about me?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Oh, tell me, do you ever think about it?
Those lonely nights when you 'bout lost it (Oh)

Now you gone, gone, gone
Tell me, how you do that to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

530,Kiss,Prince And The Revolution,"[Verse 1]
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

[Bridge]
Yes, oh, I think I wanna dance, uh
Gotta, gotta, oh
Little Girl Wendy's Parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta

[Verse 3]
Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with!
I just want your extra time and your kiss"

You shine like a star
You know who you are
You're everything beautiful
She's hot, hot like the Sun
The loneliest one
Still everything beautiful
Well I'll be goddamned

Until the stars lost the war
So Friday night, Holy Ghost
Take me to your level
Show me the one I need the most

I wish I knew you when I was young
We could've got so high

Oh, I wish I knew you when I was young

[Verse 2]
Truth, it's all that you need

534,Hooked,Dylan Scott,"[Verse 1]
It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was sounding right
But there you were
Just flirty dancing
By the neon sign
To fishing in the dark and
Reeling in my heart
And I look where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

[Verse 2]
It's Saturday
Still asleep and I could leave, but no way
This ain't a one night fling kinda thing
Wanna wake you up
Wanna press my luck
And my lips on your cheek
Like I can't enough cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked"
535,Views,Drake,"[Intro: The Winans]
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah"

Every time that you lift me up

Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornado's too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you

You cannot break down what can't be broken

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

There he was. He could never know she could never give his name
Ulay, Ulay, Oh

Thinking back to the last time
On the wall as he turned away
Turning back, did he even know?
Did he ever hear her say:
""Ulay, Ulay, Oh""?

Trying her best to foget him
Trying her best just to keep her stride
Ulay, Ulay, Oh
Ulay, Ulay, Oh

There they were like the picture
There they were, they were just the same
There they were, but he walked away and her eyes could only say:
""Ulay, Ulay, Oh"""

551,Save It For A Rainy Day,Kenny Chesney,"[Verse 1]
It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Verse 3]
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole

Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me

Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times

Don't tempt me, big bullet holes

I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know

Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from

You been blabbin', you been bickerin'

Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry

Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit

Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

So who are we to trust anyone?

Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

[Outro]
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers"
559,Dark Side Of The Moon,Lil Wayne Featuring Nicki Minaj,"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon as she wear slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I tune into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
560,Let's Go Crazy,Prince And The Revolution,"[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah-s ah-s) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Ad lib/Instrumental break]
C'mon baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed

In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks

Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes

Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in

Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing

(Johnny Juliano)
(Cardo got wings)
Adam gibi zencilerin boku
Senin yerinde başka bir gece, bu şey gibiydi, ben
Siyah, 40, OB
Oturduk buraya ve hayat hakkında konuştuk
Beatler çaldık, fakat size söylemeyi unuttuğum bir şey var

[Verse 1: Game]
Zenciler bana seni satmam için geldi
Gelip seni vurmamı istediler
Çünkü bizim mahalleden değildin tıpkı Biggie gibi
Diddy ile olan sikimsonikleri duydum
Sonra bende seni korumaya geldim
Ve 40'da korumam altında, Hush'da korumam altında
Göğsünde adamlık olan herkes için korumam var ve ne
Bende birleşmiş LA var
Bize sataşmak yerine intihara tenezzül et, gangsterler bize sataşamıyor
Gördün mü, platinum plus gibi hissetmek nasıl biliyorum
Yavşaklar seni kıskanıyor, seni kesmek istiyorlar
Senden kazanç sağlamak istiyorlar, ama bu OVO/Blood Money
Moruklar otobüs yakalar gibi kurşunları yakalıyor
Birader, ünün anası sikilmiş
Yavşaklara dört tane iyilik yap ve beşinciyi yapma
Bu kadar çabuk nasıl unutuyorlar
Babaannenin evine koşuyorlar ve sana dokuz tane sıkıyorlar tıpkı Fif' gibi
Bir zenci sizi nasıl sevebilir yavşaklar?
Kalp hızlı atmaya başlıyor, size sarılıp el sıkışırken yavşaklar
Dre bana, size güvenmemem gerektiğini söylemişti yavşaklar
Sizin enerjiniz bitmiş, siz mızmızsınız, sizi ezip geçiyorum yavşaklar
Evin etrafında dolaşıyorum şey gibi, ""Neden bir zenci yaşayamıyor?""
Al bu parayı, sik şu kaltakları
Yine de kavga hakkında düşünüyorum şunun gibi:
""Biz bu amına koyduğum aletleri kullanabiliriz, bir doktor gibi""
Burası benim şehrim moruk herkes biliyor
Bölge de dolaşırım, sadece ben ve benim Four Pound'um
Tom Hord'umun içine sıkıştırılmış, umarım ki göstermeme gerek kalmaz
L.A zencileri, en delileri, bu zenciler çılgınca sikimler yapıyor
Zenciler senin arabanın içine atlayabilir, seni savunmasız yakalar
Tıpkı Lil Wayne ve Baby'de olduğu gibi
40, amı götü dağıttım

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Hiç biriniz stüdyoma gelmeyin eğer ki sahteyseniz
Hiç biriniz cenazeme gelmeyin eğer ki sahteyseniz
Hepiniz anlayın benimle yapabileceğiniz hiç bir şey yok
Sizden tek istediğim benimle 92'ye sekiz eklemeniz, yüz
(L.A zencileri, en delileri) evet, yüz
(L.A), sizden tek istediğim yüz
(L.A, L.A zencileri, en delileri) evet yüz
Sizden tek istediğim yüz

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sonra teşekkür et, hiç bir şey için et, blöfün için et
Sana çok çok teşekkür ederim; tüm gerçek renklerini giydiğin için
Ayrı ayrı her bir sikik işlevinde
Eskiden nasıl aile olduğumuzu yüzüme söyleyen zenciler var
Ve beni nasıl sevdiklerini, bütçenin kaymaklarını yerken
Şimdi onları görüyorum, komik davranan onlar
İnsanlar bana ulaşmaya çalışıyor
Ve bense tam anlamıyla tepkisizce boklardayım Çok daha fazla arkadaşım olurdu
Eğer param, saygım ve yeteneğim olmasaydı
Çok daha fazla arkadaşım olurdu
Eğer gerçeklere sırtımı dönsem ve yalakaca laflar etsem  Senin tüm hayranların benim olurdu, eğer pop'a kaymasaydım
Ve hala bilinçli bir şekilde bu bokta kalsaydım
Çok çok daha dazla arkadaşım olurdu
Eğer başarımı ve özgüvenimi kaybetseydim
Klüpte yarışma başlattıklarında her seferinde orada oluyorum
Hatta yarışmayı başlatmasalar bile aldıkları tepkileri görebiliyorum
Evet, piramitin tepesinde sizi kimse duyamaz
Belki de tekrar Jamaika'ya gidip, ortadan kaybolmalı
Çemberim fazla daraldı, bir nokta gibi, kendime diyorum ki...

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Hiç biriniz stüdyoma gelmeyin eğer ki sahteyseniz
Hiç biriniz cenazeme gelmeyin eğer ki sahteyseniz
Hepiniz anlayın benimle yapabileceğiniz hiç bir şey yok

Sizden tek istediğim yüz

[Verse 3: Game]
4 Cent'i özlüyorum, o gerçek bir zenciydi
O zenciyi tuttum, ufaklığından beri
Eğer hayatta olsaydı, gebertirdi yavşakları
O Lil Snupe'se, ben Meek Mill'dim
Moruklar, biraderini özlemenin nasıl bir his olduğunu biliyor ve
Düşünemiyorsun, sonra sarıyorsun Indigo'yu
Streslisin, sürerken Aşağı Figuero'ya
Onun hayaleti benim Ghost'umda olana kadar yap esrar dumanından bulut, hassiktir
Adam gibi bi' zenci yap, hayatını Tanrı'ya verirken, ""İşte gidiyoruz"" desin
Frog'un ismini bulutlara haykırıyorum, beni yeterince duymuyorlar
Galiba onlar 2Pac ve Biggie ile fazla meşguller ve
Siz yavşaklar hala beni yeterince anlamıyorsunuz
Bu Suge'un nöbetiydi, ben alıyorum Suge'un nöbetini
Drizzy'e diss mi attın, iyi güzel, ama benim şehrime gelme
H-Town'a bile
O kadar Underground ki, konuşurken titremem lazım
Belden aşağısı silahlı
Bu Pimp C, J Prince'e birer laftı, onlar gerçek zenciydi
Bu bok çok basitti Henchman oyun dışı kaldığında
Onun genç bi' zencisi vardı, hemen Meech'in yanında
Mutluydum, Bleu Davinci dışarı çıktığında
Birlikte California'nın sokaklarından çıktık
L.A zencileri, en delileri, bu zenciler çılgınca sikimler yapıyor
Zenciler senin arabanın içine atlayabilir, seni savunmasız yakalar
Tıpkı Lil Wayne ve Baby'de olduğu gibi
Kafası karışmış bi' zenci mi var, ama neden bi' zenci seçmek zorunda?
Bir şey ifade etmiyor moruk çünkü ben her zaman gerçek bi zenci olacağım
Her zaman gerçek bi zenci olacağım
Asla gerçek bir zenci olmak dışında bir şey öğrenmedim

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Hiç biriniz stüdyoma gelmeyin eğer ki sahteyseniz

Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now I can be your vice

All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix

You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body's saying everything
I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight

All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix

Danny, I see you

[Chorus]
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope

[Verse 1]
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Climb right in, let me break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober
Still never sober

You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope, I-I-I

[Verse 2]
I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames, I
I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We shot a scene on some movie shit
And she came right through on some groupie shit
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't

She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, nigga, yes I smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope, I"
579,Roller Coaster,Luke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

[Chorus 2]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster"
580,Love Wins,Carrie Underwood,"[Verse 1]
A stray bullet and a mama  cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again

Oh, yeah, love wins

Don't hit me up when it's good for you

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground

But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground
I've got no roots
I've got no roots

I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

[Verse 4]
I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on

You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darling
You don't want a heart

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends

585,"Two Birds, One Stone",Drake,"[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?"
586,Mess,Lil Wayne,"[Chorus]
Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

[Bridge]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 2]
Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Bridge]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey care less
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Outro]
Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
Fuck it more ones, fuck it, more ones
I'm​ making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's"

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheap coat
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
These tattoos, they can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero

Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl

No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He got me center my evil
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks"
589,Famous,Lil Wayne Featuring Reginae Carter,"[Chorus: Reginae Carter]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Yeah)
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night (Yeah)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, ""Oh my God""
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: ""Don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twistin' life up when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, ""Can you look this way? Can you look this way?""
Flash! I must be famous

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV, mama!)
This is how you live your life (Yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Refrain]
You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, ""Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me""
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous)

Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
And I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'

I chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we toolie'd up
I be tryna change my life, but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(Skrrr, skrrr) All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K (And I'ma keep it one hundo)
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

Pull up to the back, black Zac, chief rockin'
And the Feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'
Ritz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times
Forty niggas strapped, we the '49ers
Bite down, Karlton Hines
Got two twin bitches doin' 69
Jump off to the mula and you know that
50 chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak
I remember totin' .38, now I got a semi
Could have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
20 million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Shut the fuck up with them loose walls
Matter fact, I'm not gon' go back and forth
With you bitches like Duval and Snoop Dogg
These bitches front like a new bra
Don't get your ass dragged like RuPaul

For all the pain

There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity

Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain

Tell me how much you need this

Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go

Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That’s what we oughta do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature, oh

603,Think A Little Less,Michael Ray,"[Verse 1]
Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

[Chorus]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

[Verse 2]
When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then
Kiss a little more

[Chorus]
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

[Verse 3]
I'll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing
Since the moment, girl, we met

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

604,Do Not Disturb,Drake,"[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
And see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
Than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)

I started this shit, you just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp
And your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money
Like, ""Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?""
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet tangy
I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch
If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit
Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit
In the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, ""Suu whoop,"" and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo

Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

[Verse 2]
You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling (Darling)

Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

Where I'm goin', but I've got to go

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along

I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt

Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

[Hook]
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', ""One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive!""
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as ""That King""
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""

Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

618,Head Above Water,Avril Lavigne,"[Verse 1]
I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(I keep my head above water, above water)
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

[Bridge]
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

[Chorus]
So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

[Outro]
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water
(Don't let me, don't let me drown)"

620,Raspberry Beret,Prince And The Revolution,"[Intro]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, Uh!

[Verse 1]
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her"

622,You & Me,Marc E. Bassy Featuring G-Eazy,"[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more"
623,Raise 'Em Up,Keith Urban Featuring Eric Church,"[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
Raise 'em up
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like and you sing along
Raise em up
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
A comin' home, you've been gone too long
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
Raise 'em up
You got a voice, you got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are
Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

[Verse 3: Keith Urban]
So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong
Raise 'em up right from wrong
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me

627,What Makes You Country,Luke Bryan,"[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

[Outro]
You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country"

Genre, ces négros sont vraiment sauvages"", tu vois ce que je veux dire ?
On ne joue pas avec vous tous ces négros, t'entends ?
Parfois, il faut juste que tu choppes la chlamydia en baisant ces négros, bails de gangsters
Tu vois ce que je veux dire ? Gonorrhée, toute cette merde
Touuute cette merde
J'attrape toutes les maladies du monde
Pour que le monde n'ait plus aucune maladie, tu saisis ?
Bails de gangsters
Ouais, ouais

P. Soul sur le beat

[Couplet 1 : Joey Bada$$$]
Je suis aussi vrai qu'ils viennent, ils le ressentent, deviennent insensibles
Tu penses que tu as un peu de buzz, alors maintenant tu ne peux pas te faire piquer ?
Je garde une lame de rasoir près de moi, sous ma langue
Ne me force pas à dire à ces négros la ville d'où je viens
C'est Brooklyn, soit la maison du plus dur (ouais)
Là où les négros ne visent pas, ils ne font que tâter le Beretta (bang)
Et bombarder quoi que ce soit, dire que nous ne bougeons pas calmement, jamais (non)
C'est pour mes négros piégés dans des cellules comme la salmonelle
Ecoute, je pourrais faire cette merde sans effort
Pas de pression, pas de gimmicks, pas d'enregistrements radio
Juste une rime de style manuel avec la texture brute
Des punchlines, des riffs, c'est une trinité
Plus de conférences gratuites, je taxe ces négros en plus
C'est le Pro de tous les Eras, il est de retour dans ton secteur
Donc, il vaudrait mieux protéger ton cou
Ou professe ta dette envers dieu, il pourrait te bénir

[Couplet 2 : XXXTENTACION]
Trucide ces flow comme je trucide ces gro, ces putains
Où est passée ton énergie, bro ?
Fais une gorge profonde à ton gro avec un Desert Eagle
S'il me teste comme une pute, baltringue, c'est à mon compte
Métamorphose de mon flow, pas d'expression comme un lifting
Je pourrais probablement me balancer comme huit poignées si tu parles de ces singeries
Je ne parle pas de YMBAPE, mais je me tape sur la poitrine, salope
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Je voyage à travers l'infini, heu
Tu n'es pas ce négro, prétends l'être, heu
Toutes ces conneries ne m'atteignent pas, heu
Je suis un esprit, une entité, heu
Tu veux juste aspirer toute mon énergie, heu
Je suis le plus vrai depuis Kennedy, heu
T'es un connard de négro de merde, tu sonnes pareil
Je recrache la douleur, c'est pour ça que les jeunes négros ressentent la même chose
Ils savent que je bang, je sors un putain de pistolet du Range et j'agis comme un fou

Tell me, am I going crazy?
Tell me, have I lost my mind?
Am I just afraid of loving?
Or am I not the loving kind?

Kissing in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Getting old
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah
Cause I can't do it anymore

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love

Maybe I'm too picky honey
But I'm not in the world you're in
I'm not in it for the money
I'm here looking for the real thing

Kissin' in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Gettin' old (It's gettin' old!)
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold (So, so, so cold!)
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, no

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)

The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love

I'm tired of dreaming of no one (I'm tired)
I need some body next to mine (I-I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone (give it to someone)
Because I can't do it anymore

It's that Young Sinatra shit, yeah, that's that Young Sinatra shit
Shut the fuck up and listen whenever Young Sinatra spit
Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!
Listen, yeah—I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows
Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levels–I've passed those

Fuck that trap shit, this that rap shit
Give me the head like John the Baptist
Ready to rip it, I hope in the captives
Greatest alive like I'm Cassius
I put 'em all in they caskets, they can't seem to get past it
I'm a bastard that mastered the flow
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, ""Fuck the police!""—Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit
You got your Jim Carrey on—
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya
Number one till I die, will never retire
I am the Messiah, I am the god of this shit
This is how we do it—yeah, I started this shit
Yes, I started this shit like–

Real G's move in silence like—
Who the common denominator?
Fuck around and bomb a hater
My flow greater, heart darker than Darth Vader
Check the data, matter of fact, check the state of mind
After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds
Brace yourself, you can't retain me
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim
Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
Step to me, throw disrespect to me
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?—Goddamn
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'

From Maryland to Venice, this shit is worldwide
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
Nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

Nothing breaks like a heart

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man?
God level I am the I am (whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick; Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife""
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards

And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa

On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road

All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you
Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood

Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm comin' back
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh

I'm lovin' your light, vulnerable
Lettin' your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
To keep alive in the winter time, aye, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Like why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneakin' glances thankin’ God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmmm
And she seen my best side, mmmm, mmm

Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat

Now could you tell me like it is?

Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

[Chorus 1]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

[Chorus 2]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

[Outro]
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?"

666,Leave The Night On,Sam Hunt,"[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand

But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole

Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine

Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin', yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it

[Verse 2: Future]
I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch, you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make so much money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I gotta maintain, I'm superior, nigga
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

[Refrain: Future]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us

[Hook: Future]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip got a whole lot of 30
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'"
676,Liability,Lorde,"[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, ""You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun"

Hoy la disco se explota
Me gustan tus ojo' o será tu nota
He viaja'o el mundo y como tú he visto poca'
Tú quieres ser buena y la malicia se te nota

Tengo un par de baby', nunca se pone celosa
Se tira fotos sin ropa, ella es peligrosa
Se mira al espejo y haciéndolo ella me posa (porque ella es)

Una bebé que quiere ser la más que sabe, es lo que yo sé
Hoy vino con un traje aparte, yo la toqué
Es única y sólo yo se lo puedo ver
Dime, ¿qué vas a hacer?
Ya está saliendo el sol, sé que tú quiere' calor
Somo' amigo' de amor, no queremo' relación
Sale y no tiene control, no fuma y le gusta el olor
Ella no tiene valor
Conmigo lo hace sin temor, porque

But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah

You and your friends, up in my car
Rolling up J’s, flying with the stars
Don’t gotta ask the price ‘cause you already know
Watch full of ice, no light it still glow
With you and your friends, me and my dogs
Left your nigga to be with my squad
He talk a lot of shit, but he ain’t really on
He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like
Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy
I want you to be my lady
Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain’t hating

I’m parked outfront in a Range Rover
Coke white, so tight, game over
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all, more y’all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Bet she pay what she weigh
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

I got all these J’s rolled up
And I got all these drinks poured up

683,Side Effects,The Chainsmokers Featuring Emily Warren,"[Verse 1: Emily Warren]
It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

[Pre-Chorus 1: Emily Warren]
That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

[Chorus 1: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Verse 2: Emily Warren]
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

[Pre-Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
But, ooh, if late night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

[Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Bridge: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line

[Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
I, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Outro: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (Yeah)"

685,Needy,Ariana Grande,"[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed"
686,Rock On,Tucker Beathard,"[Verse 1]
Girl I really did mean it when I wished you the best
Good to hear you're killing it way out west
Finding your own way didn't take too long
Baby rock on, rock on

[Verse 2]
It's getting tough keeping up with where you are
Posting pics like some big Hollywood star
Guess every club in town is playing your song
Baby rock on, rock on

[Chorus]
Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I do a lotta thinking about wanting you back
But I don't know about all dolled up like that
If my homegrown country girl's long gone
Then baby rock on, rock on

[Chorus]
Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on
Yeah, rock on

[Bridge]
I saw your hashtag, digging on some new dude
Girl, you left me with nothing else to do

[Chorus 2]
Rock on like I don't miss you
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til I forget you, just like I wish I would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

[Outro]
Baby rock on
Yeah, I should've put a rock on
Yeah, baby rock on
Yeah, I really did mean it when I wished you the best"
687,Greatest,Eminem,"[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, ""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-snot gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips got the cig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I know one day I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest"
688,Stepping Stone,Eminem,"[Intro]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot…

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

690,Amnesia,5 Seconds Of Summer,"[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Part 1: Eminem]
Er kommt heim mit zerkratztem Hals, um Kritik einzustecken
Sweatjacke und Anzughose, nicht zusammenpassend
In seinem Atem Jack, er ist ein Sexsüchtiger
Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal
Hi Suzanne, aber ich hätte sagen sollen: „Bye Suzanne“
Nach der ersten Nacht, aber heute Nacht bin ich

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

[Bridge: Eminem]
One-Night-Stand, wurde zu einem Two-Night-Stand
Es war „Komm, Sonnenlicht, verschwinde“, jetzt umarmen wir uns fest und...

[Part 2: Eminem]
Er hat es rausgefunden, jetzt fühlt sie sich verlassen und benutzt
Denn er ist abgehauen, na und? Er hat es ihr außerdem zuerst angetan
Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen

Mein Name ist (ooh), mein Name ist (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), Fluss ströme
Nennt mich (ooh), nennt mich (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), wir werden den Fluss strömen lassen

[Part 3]
Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines (es tut mir leid)
Ich möchte nichts zugeben (ich habe es vermasselt)
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen"

Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich
Hold it down"
696,Kids,OneRepublic,"[Verse 1]
Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we’ll never die

[Verse 2]
Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

[Bridge]
Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

[Chorus]
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we’ll never change

Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

699,Cecilia And The Satellite,Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness,"[Verse 1]
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I've loved some girls that I barely knew
I've made some friends, and I've lost some too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I've learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Verse 2]
Cafe crawling through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I've seen London, and I played Japan
I've been knocked down, I got up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
For all the places I have been
I'm no place without you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

For all the things my hands have held
The best by far is you

So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe

Leave me just as empty as the day you came
And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain

The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep

The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth

See I had no choice but to lie to you, see
If I told you the truth, you'd have set me free

Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees""

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

[Verse 2]
I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, ""Hang on baby, better pull over for this""
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (whoa!)
Mikrofon başına geçtiğimiz zaman
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (whoa!)
Biz benzer değiliz, mikrofon başında benzerlik yok (yeah!)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Ben Jordans giymem, Audemars saat takmam
Patlamalar yaratır molotoflar atarım
Hepiniz sanki hiç yıkanmamışçasına tüttürüyorsunuz
Ben araba egzozundan duman patlatırım
Davet edilmediğim partilere giderim, sokaklar bana ihtiyaç duyuyor gibi hissediyorum
Ferrari Spyder'ım C Breezy gibi hareket ettikçe dans etmeme gerek yok
Kiralık katil tutmaya ihtiyaç duymam
Onun yerine ayı satın alıp özgürce nefes almayı tercih ederim
Gökyüzü mavi, kravatım yeni
Maserati'm beyaz ve cool, G-Eazy gibi
Diğerleri freestyle'larımın nasıl da benim gibi uçtuğunu
Anlamaya çalışırken
Ben Kapri Styles ve Mya G'yi nasıl sikebilirim diye düşünüyorum
Herkes korkakça davranmakta
Büyük ihtimalle bu küçük adamları yumruk noktasında soyacağım
Hatırlayın eskiden herkes Nickel'ı taklit ederdi
Şimdi herkes Bitcoin peşinde
Bizim hiçbir ortak noktamız yok (Hayır)
Bizim hiçbir ortak noktamız yok (Hayır)
Hepiniz ikili Styrofoam bardaklarının peşindesiniz
Hepiniz uyuşturucu ve yatıştırıcılar peşindesiniz
Ben virgülleri çiftleme peşindeyim
Bana bu boktan işleri sayacak ve bu saçmalığı bitirecek
Sağlam bir kardeş bulun
Polisler bize tuzak kurduğunda, bokun üstüne sifon çekebiliriz
Sikimize takamayız, lanet olsun, sikik kolonik bir durum
Takipçi için sikinizi ve götünüzü satıyorsunuz
Herhalde birkaç dolar ile, toz kokusu üstünüzde
Şu an ise korunmasızsınız, buna güç gezisi deyin, birkaç politiğin ürünü bu
Hepiniz kazançlı bir halde listelerin tepesindeyken
Bir park kenarında bok çukuruna düştünüz
Tecrübe güçtür, ama ona sahipsen ve onu anlayamazsan güçsüzdür
Hepinizin müziği kulağıma sanki size Dr. Seuss ilham vermiş gibi geliyor
Striptizciler kiralanıyor, kaltaklar emekli oluyor
Sizin gelişmeniz için rap yapabiliriz
Ben kral olmak için uygunum, siz ise Prince'ın ortası kesik pantolonu gibisiniz
Siz zenciler --

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Beyin ölümü, göz yaşı
Ağrı kesici, tek gözlü dev
Sedir, iPod
""May-back"", Maybach
Tren kazaları, kaldırımlar
Daha az öde, yüksek topuklular
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, buz küpü

[Chorus: Eminem]
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (whoa!)
Mikrofon başına geçtiğimiz zaman
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (whoa!)
Biz benzer değiliz, mikrofon başında benzerlik yok (yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Diyorsun ki senin katillerle bağlantın varmış (ayy)
Senin şu takıldığın serserilik yapanlarla (gang)
Ama sen sadece taklitçi bir tetikçisin (gang)
Sanki bir bok yapabilecekmişsin gibi
Cesetlerin varmış gibi davranıyorsun (ayy)
Ve bir saygınlık elde etmişsin, küçük genç, saçmalıyorsun
Senin bir adli sicil kaydın bile yok pil ile bağlantılı olarak
Kaltak sen hiçbir prize takılmadın bile
Rap God lirikal mermiler yağdırmıştı (boom)
Ve siz silahlı abiler, partnerlerin silahlarını kuşansa iyi eder
Bunun kas gücü ile ilgisi yok
Ama silahlarınız vardır kesin, hadi çıkarın
Belinize bağlayın, başka bir deyişle
Eğer çetenle üstüme geleceksen bol cephaneli bir orduyla gelmen gerek
Çünkü bu cümleler aklının alamayacağı derecede
Yani eğer silah çekeceksen kolların olsa iyi olur (skrrt)
Oh, demek sokaklar senden sorulur ha?
Şimdi gelip benle sidik yarıştırıyorsun ha?
Bu küçük yarak sevici bayağı bir gaza gelmiş olmalı
Sert tavırlarını sürdürmek istiyor
Sonra bir düet yapıyor, Nina ile takım olmaya karar veriyor
Ama bir sonraki sefer, eğer bana bir hafif makineli tüfek ile saldıracaksan, Machine Gun
Tech N9ne'ı kullanmana gerek yok
Ve sana konuşuyorum, ama sen zaten ne sikim olduğunu çok iyi biliyorsun, Kelly
Ben öyle sübliminal kullanmam, gizli diss atmam
Ama kızım Hailie hakkında konuşmaya devam edersen
Ve her ihtimale karşı her boku unuttuysan, Ja Rule ilgili olayları hatırlamaya ihtiyacın olursa
Anılar çilek ya da ananas, kayısı reçeli gibi kavanozlanmışsa
Ben de konuşmaya devam edeceğim orospu evlatları
Ben nadiren yanıt veririm, ama bu sefer Shady fazlasıyla zinde
Sanki tetiği çekilmiş bir Glock gibi, yarı Tanrı gibi
Şu benim hakkımda basmakalıp konuşan zararsız sarı kafalı velete susturucu takmama izin verin
Hazır değilsin, aptal, artık pes et Rocksteady Crew gibi
Apaçık ortadaki, bunun üstesinden gelmiyorum
Redenbach gibi olay çıkarabiliriz, Remy Ma gibi sağa sola ateş edebiliriz
Fazlasıyla ağır silahlı, Godzilla, sert kabuklu ve acımasız
Bizarre'ın göbeğinden daha büyük bir kalp ile birlikte
Benim kaybettiğimi konuşabileceğin tek an Fetty Wap hakkında konuştuğun zamandır
Diddy'yi arasan iyi edersin, rahatlamama yardımcı olmak için
Ve Trick Trick'i aramamam için dua etsen iyi edersin
Kaltak, bu bok bizim şehrimizde takılamaz
Serseri velet, OG'lere saygısızlık etmeyeceksin, Prodigy huzur içinde yatsın
Dre'ye ruhumu sattım ve beni şirketine aldığında ona dedim ki
Ben en çok nefret edilen olacağım, yine de başardım
Yani ortada bir ayıp yok, sahip olmakta bir sorun yok
Çünkü hayat bir kaltak, çarpık bacaklı bir orospu
Ama artık o günler bitti
Ben önü açık gezen bornozlu Harvey Weinstein'ım
Benim kod adım gizli tacizci, losyonla role play yaparım
Tüm dünyayı sikeceğim ve üstüne Trojan atı salacağım
Ev yapımı patlayıcılarla kaltakları eğlendireceğim
Üstünde seksen delik açacağım
Beni zorlamayın, ben flowları katlederim, ve
Hasara hakaret ederim, Rolaids'ten Goldman'e
Dre'ye Motrin atarım, Nicole'u boğazlarım
Her ikisi de boğulmak için oradayken ve tüm tabaklarım ıslanırken
Ben iki tarafı da sivri bir kılıcım, yani bir mekana adım attığımda
Kılıcı sokarım ve dönme hareketiyle döndürürüm
Kalemle görünmezim, hastalıklı davranışların son noktasındayım
Sikimi sokarım ve minimal muazzamlıklar sunarım
Bu heceleri sikiyorum, genital bölgemi yalamalarına izin veriyorum
Ben yenilmezim, affedilmezim, zorlu bir kalleşim
Az biraz da tahmin edilemezim, ben harikuladeliği rapliyorum
İşte kaltaklar, orijinalde uğraştığınız kişi bu
Ben kendimi ve Nickel'ı eş sayıyorum, ama sizi değil
Ortak tek noktamız ben bir yarrağım ve siz de yalıyorsunuz
Bunun haricinde bunlardan birinin diğeriyle hiçbir alakası yoktur
Kokarca, böcek, asker
Dil, çalı, omuz, bir ay büyük
Sünger, çete, daha soğuk, hiçbiri, kilim, tabanca kılıfı
Bijon somunu, bardak altlığı, akciğer, güveçte kavurma
Young Thug posteri, fişten çekilmiş tost makinesi

[Chorus: Eminem]
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (whoa!)
Mikrofon başına geçtiğimiz zaman
İşte bu kadar ortak noktamız var (yeah!)

Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end

So I walk into the club like everybody hates me

I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, ""Poor me,"" I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me

709,Love Someone,Lukas Graham,"[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

[Chorus]
But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do"
710,I Met A Girl,William Michael Morgan,"[Verse 1]
She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl

[Verse 2]
The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world

[Bridge]
She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl"
711,Come Back To Earth,Mac Miller,"[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head"

I'm bipolar with the switch-up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be Rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie

You're tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola
Estás de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola

I'm an emotional wreck, weak (Uh-huh)
Everything over-affects me (Yeah)
When you joke, it upsets me (Yeah)
You say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy (Uh-huh)
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (Yep)
You hope I choke on a Pepsi (Yep)
Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (Oh)
Been textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin' to house sit
In that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing, why
Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?"

And today's not feeling like it used to
You got stuck up in that life that you was used to
If you got hurt, yeah, I got hurt, yeah, I got bruised too
That's the main reason why I had to choose you
If you got options I got options, baby, who you?
I got one that's on my line that look like new new
She got ass just like a zebra on a zoo too
So basically what I'm saying, I'm not scared to lose you

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down

Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real, know

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher—

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.This civil action was brought under 42 U. S. C.  1983 and 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties,[1] ""these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, *188 are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes,"" was dismissed by a three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C.  2281 in the Middle District of Tennessee.[2] The court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. 179 F. Supp. 824. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 364 U. S. 898.[3] We hold that the dismissal was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The General Assembly of Tennessee consists of the Senate with 33 members and the House of Representatives with 99 members. The Tennessee Constitution provides in Art. II as follows:
""Sec. 3. Legislative authorityTerm of office. The Legislative authority of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, both dependent on the people; who shall hold their offices for two years from the day of the general election.""Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.""Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several *189 periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.""Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.""Thus, Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications.[4] Decennial reapportionment *190 in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901. The 1871 apportionment[5] was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration.[6] The 1881 apportionment involved three statutes, the first authorizing an enumeration, the second enlarging the Senate from 25 to *191 33 members and the House from 75 to 99 members, and the third apportioning the membership of both Houses.[7] In 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment.[8] In 1901 the General Assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the Federal Census and passed the Apportionment Act here in controversy.[9] In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass.[10]

*192 Between 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In 1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote.[11] The 1960 Federal Census reports the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote.[12] The relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901 Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.

Indeed, the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute, even as of the time of its passage, ""made no apportionment of Representatives and Senators in accordance with the constitutional formula . . . , but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the Senate and House without reference . . . to any logical or reasonable formula whatever.""[13] It is further alleged *193 that ""because of the population changes since 1900, and the failure of the Legislature to reapportion itself since 1901,"" the 1901 statute became ""unconstitutional and obsolete."" Appellants also argue that, because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 Apportionment Act, redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning, or any other change short of that, is difficult or impossible.[14] The complaint concludes that ""these plaintiffs *194 and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes.""[15] They seek a *195 declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it. They also pray that unless and until the General Assembly enacts a valid reapportionment, the District Court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the Tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent Federal Census figures, or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections, primary and general, at large. They also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriate.
I.THE DISTRICT COURT'S OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL.Because we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees' motions, precise identification *196 of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the District Court rested in dismissing the case. The dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees' grounds ""(1) that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . .""

In the setting of a case such as this, the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal:

First: That the facts and injury alleged, the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon, and the relief sought, fail to come within that language of Article III of the Constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which United States District Courts are empowered to act;

Second: That, although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants' rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard, the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment.

We treat the first ground of dismissal as ""lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter."" The second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action.

The District Court's dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the court's per curiam opinion. The opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds. After noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in Tennessee under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested, the court stated that
""The action is presently before the Court upon the defendants' motion to dismiss predicated upon three *197 grounds: first, that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter; second, that the complaints fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and third, that indispensable party defendants are not before the Court."" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the case's presenting a ""question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes."" For,
""From a review of [numerous Supreme Court] . . . decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule, as enunciated and applied by the Supreme Court, is that the federal courts, whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration, will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment."" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs. 179 F. Supp., at 827-828. Then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged, but of a court's impotence to correct that violation:
""With the plaintiffs' argument that the legislature of Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the Court entirely agrees. It also agrees that the evil is a serious one which should be corrected without further delay. But even so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the courts. It has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot give redress."" 179 F. Supp., at 828.In light of the District Court's treatment of the case, we hold today only (a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of *198 action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) because appellees raise the issue before this Court, that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.[16] Beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the District Court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found, it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trial.
II.JURISDICTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER.The District Court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial considerationwhat we have designated ""nonjusticiability."" The distinction between the two grounds is significant. In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. In the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not ""arise under"" the Federal Constitution, laws or treaties (or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Art. III,  2), or is not a ""case or controversy"" within the meaning of that section; or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute. Our conclusion, see pp. 208-237. infra, that this cause presents no nonjusticiable ""political question"" settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy. Under the present heading of ""Jurisdiction *199 of the Subject Matter"" we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the Constitution and is within 28 U. S. C.  1343.

Article III,  2, of the Federal Constitution provides that ""The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . ."" It is clear that the cause of action is one which ""arises under"" the Federal Constitution. The complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would, therefore, be justified only if that claim were ""so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,"" Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, 193 U. S. 561, 579, or ""frivolous,"" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 683.[17] That the claim is unsubstantial must be ""very plain."" Hart v. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, 262 U. S. 271, 274. Since the District Court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous, it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. And of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter. We said in an earlier voting case from Tennessee: ""It is obvious . . . that the court, in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the Federal right. But as the very nature of the controversy was Federal, and, therefore, *200 jurisdiction existed, whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason, it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States."" Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 493. ""For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction."" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682. See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U. S. 291, 305-308.

Since the complaint plainly sets forth a case arising under the Constitution, the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in Art. III,  2, and so within the power of Congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Congress has exercised that power in 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3):
""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law[18] to be commenced by any person . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . .""[19]
*201 An unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature. The first cases involved the redistricting of States for the purpose of electing Representatives to the Federal Congress. When the Ohio Supreme Court sustained Ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to Art. I,  4, of the Federal Constitution, we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction ""In view . . . of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it . . . ."" Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 570. When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the Secretary of State of Minnesota from acting under Minnesota redistricting legislation, we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the State Supreme Court. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355. And see companion cases from the New York Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380. When a three-judge District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), permanently enjoined officers of the State of Mississippi from conducting an election of Representatives under a Mississippi redistricting act, we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the District Court. Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, reversing 1 F. Supp. 134. A similar decree of a District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the same statute, concerning a Kentucky redistricting act, was *202 reviewed and the decree reversed. Mahan v. Hume, 287 U. S. 575, reversing 1 F. Supp. 142.[20]

The appellees refer to Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as authority that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. Appellees misconceive the holding of that case. The holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it. Seven members of the Court participated in the decision. Unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction, all three opinions filed in Colegrove discussed the question. Two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the Justices, a majority, flatly held that there was jurisdiction of the subject matter. MR. JUSTICE BLACK joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice Murphy stated: ""It is my judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction . . . ,"" citing the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), and Bell v. Hood, supra. 328 U. S., at 568. Mr. Justice Rutledge, writing separately, expressed agreement with this conclusion. 328 U. S., at 564, 565, n. 2. Indeed, it is even questionable that the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by Justices Reed and Burton, doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter. Such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in Wood v. Broom, supra. 328 U. S., at 551.

Several subsequent cases similar to Colegrove have been decided by the Court in summary per curiam statements. None was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. Cook v. Fortson, 329 U. S. 675; Turman v. *203 Duckworth, ibid.; Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804;[21]Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940; Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916; Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936; Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912; Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920; Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991; Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916; Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127.[22]

Two cases decided with opinions after Colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within District Court jurisdiction. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which had been invoked under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for state-wide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the State's 102 counties. This Court's disagreement with that action is clear since the Court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit. In South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the Georgia ""county unit"" system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, which allegedy existed under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). The express words of our holding were that ""Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing *204 political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions."" 339 U. S., at 277.

We hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint.
III.STANDING.A federal court cannot ""pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies."" Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39. Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of standing. It is, of course, a question of federal law.

The complaint was filed by residents of Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties. Each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly representing his county.[23] These appellants sued ""on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who *205 are similarly situated . . . .""[24] The appellees are the Tennessee Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and members of the State Board of Elections; the members of the State Board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the County Election Commissioners whom they appoint.[25]

*206 We hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit. Our decisions plainly support this conclusion. Many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims.[26] And Colegrove v. Green, supra, squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.[27] A number *207 of cases decided after Colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions.[28]

These appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own, and of those similarly situated. Their constitutional claim is, in substance, that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the State's Constitution or of any standard, effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population. The injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality vis-a-vis voters *208 in irrationally favored counties. A citizen's right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.

It would not be necessary to decide whether appellants' allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will, ultimately, entitle them to any relief, in order to hold that they have standing to seek it. If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting ""a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,"" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S., at 438, not merely a claim of ""the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law . . . ."" Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129; compare Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130. They are entitled to a hearing and to the District Court's decision on their claims. ""The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury."" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163.
IV.JUSTICIABILITY.In holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green, supra, and subsequent per curiam cases.[29] The *209 court stated: ""From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule . . . is that the federal courts . . . will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment."" 179 F. Supp., at 826. We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a ""political question"" and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable ""political question."" The cited cases do not hold the contrary.

Of course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection ""is little more than a play upon words."" Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 540. Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government,[30] and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.

We hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. The District Court misinterpreted Colegrove v. Green and other decisions of this Court on which it relied. Appellants' claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if *210 ""discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights."" Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. To show why we reject the argument based on the Guaranty Clause, we must examine the authorities under it. But because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the ""political question"" doctrine.

Our discussion, even at the price of extending this opinion, requires review of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear in seeming disorderliness. Since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable, we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts. That review reveals that in the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other ""political question"" cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the ""political question.""

We have said that ""In determining whether a question falls within [the political question] category, the approriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations."" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the ""political question"" label to obscure the need for *211 case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine. We shall then show that none of those threads catches this case.

Foreign relations: There are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions.[31] Not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature;[32] but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government's views.[33] Yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences *212 of judicial action. For example, though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated, since on that question ""governmental action . . . must be regarded as of controlling importance,"" if there has been no conclusive ""governmental action"" then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer. Compare Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285, with Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, 492-495.[34] Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law. Compare Whitney v. Robertson; 124 U. S. 190, with Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 187.

While recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called ""a republic of whose existence we know nothing,""[35] and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,[36] once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared, courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.[37] Similarly, recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility, but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer, a court may construe them seeking, for example, to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure American neutrality have *213 become operative. The Three Friends, 166 U. S. 1, 63, 66. Still again, though it is the executive that determines a person's status as representative of a foreign government, Ex parte Hitz, 111 U. S. 766, the executive's statements will be construed where necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, In re Baiz, 135 U. S. 403. Similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments. Compare Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, with Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34-35.

Dates of duration of hostilities: Though it has been stated broadly that ""the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires,"" Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, 262 U. S. 51, 57, here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions, underlying this Court's refusal to review the political departments' determination of when or whether a war has ended. Dominant is the need for finality in the political determination, for emergency's nature demands ""A prompt and unhesitating obedience,"" Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30 (calling up of militia). Moreover, ""the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & W. Co., 251 U. S. 146, 161, that the war power includes the power `to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress' and continues during that emergency. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507."" Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking Co., 331 U. S. 111, 116. But deference rests on reason, not habit.[38] The question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finalitye. g., a public program of importance *214 (rent control) yet not central to the emergency effort.[39] Further, clearly definable criteria for decision may be available. In such case the political question barrier falls away: ""[A] Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . [It can] inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended."" Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543, 547-548.[40] Compare Woods v. Miller Co., 333 U. S. 138. On the other hand, even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers, lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for even-handed application may impel reference to the political departments' determination of dates of hostilities' beginning and ending. The Protector, 12 Wall. 700.

Validity of enactments: In Coleman v. Miller, supra, this Court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.[41] Similar considerations apply to the enacting process: ""The respect due to coequal and independent departments,"" and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether, as passed, it complied with all requisite formalities. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672, 676-677; see Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130, 137. But it is not true that courts will never delve *215 into a legislature's records upon such a quest: If the enrolled statute lacks an effective date, a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment. Gardner v. The Collector, 6 Wall. 499. The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.

The status of Indian tribes: This Court's deference to the political departments in determining whether Indians are recognized as a tribe, while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions,[42]United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419, also has a unique element in that ""the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. . . . [The Indians are] domestic dependent nations . . . in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian."" The Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16, 17.[43] Yet, here too, there is no blanket rule. While *216 "" `It is for [Congress] . . . , and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from [the] condition of tutelage' . . . , it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe . . . ."" United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 46. Able to discern what is ""distinctly Indian,"" ibid., the courts will strike down *217 any heedless extension of that label. They will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power.

It is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.

Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of ""political questions,"" not one of ""political cases."" The courts cannot reject as ""no law suit"" a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated ""political"" exceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing.

But it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered, cases concerning the Constitution's guaranty, in Art. IV, *218  4, of a republican form of government. A conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care. We shall discover that Guaranty Clause claims involve those elements which define a ""political question,"" and for that reason and no other, they are nonjusticiable. In particular, we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization.

Republican form of government: Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was, as Daniel Webster said in opening the argument for the defense, ""an unusual case.""[44] The defendants, admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering, sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of Rhode Island, which State was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection; that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection; and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff. The case arose ""out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of Rhode Island in 1841 and 1842,"" 7 How., at 34, and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government.[45] The plaintiff's right to *219 recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition; but the lower court's refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue, its charge to the jury that the earlier established or ""charter"" government was lawful, and the verdict for the defendants, were affirmed upon appeal to this Court.

Chief Justice Taney's opinion for the Court reasoned as follows: (1) If a court were to hold the defendants' acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question, it would follow that all of that government's actionslaws enacted, taxes collected, salaries paid, accounts settled, sentences passedwere of no effect; and that ""the officers who carried their decisions into operation [were] answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.""[46] There was, of course, no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure, for such would have defeated the plaintiff's very action. A decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos, a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the Constitution.

(2) No state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority. Indeed, the courts of Rhode Island had in several cases held that ""it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not,"" and that that department had acknowledged no change.

*220 (3) Since ""[t]he question relates, altogether, to the constitution and laws of [the] . . . State,"" the courts of the United States had to follow the state courts' decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them.[47]

(4) No provision of the Constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except Art. IV,  4, the Guaranty Clause. Having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently, Chief Justice Taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that, if any department of the United States was empowered by the Guaranty Clause to resolve the issue, it was not the judiciary:
""Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and . . . Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.
*221 ""So, too, as relates to the clause in the above-mentioned article of the Constitution, providing for cases of domestic violence. It rested with Congress, too, to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee. . . . [B]y the act of February 28, 1795, [Congress] provided, that, `in case of an insurrection in any State against the government thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on application of the legislature of such State or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), to call forth such number of the militia of any other State or States, as may be applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.'""By this act, the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere, is given to the President. . . .""After the President has acted and called out the militia, is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order. . . .""It is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the President. But upon the application of the governor under the charter government, the President recognized him as the executive power of the State, and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere . . . . [C]ertainly no court of the United States, with a knowledge of this decision, would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government *222. . . . In the case of foreign nations, the government acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the courts of justice. . . ."" 7 How., at 42-44.Clearly, several factors were thought by the Court in Luther to make the question there ""political"": the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government; the unambiguous action by the President, in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority; the need for finality in the executive's decision; and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican.[48]

*223 But the only significance that Luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the Guaranty Clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government. The Court has since refused to resort to the Guaranty Clausewhich alone had been invoked for the purposeas the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action. See Taylor & Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548 (claim that Kentucky's resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable); Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118 (claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Kiernan v. Portland, 223 U. S. 151 (claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); *224 Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250 (claim that Indiana's constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable); O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244 (claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held ""futile""); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565 (claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable);[49]Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219 (claim that workmen's compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74 (claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608 (claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government, rejected).

Just as the Court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents no justiciable question so has it held, and for the same reasons, that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the State sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the Reconstruction Acts, claiming that it already possessed ""A republican State, in every political, legal, constitutional, and juridical sense,"" and that enforcement of the new Acts ""Instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents, . . . is destroying that very government by force.""[50] Congress had clearly refused to *225 recognize the republican character of the government of the suing State.[51] It seemed to the Court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the Guaranty Clause, and Congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form, this Court refused to interfere with Congress' action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty.[52]

In only a few other cases has the Court considered Art. IV,  4, in relation to congressional action. It has refused to pass on a claim relying on the Guaranty Clause to establish that Congress lacked power to allow the States to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats. Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, supra. And it has pointed out that Congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become States, and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a *226 popularly elected legislature. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244, 278-279 (dictum).[53]

We come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable ""political question"" bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home[54] if we take issue with Tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.

This case does, in one sense, involve the allocation of political power within a State, and the appellants *227 might conceivably have added a claim under the Guaranty Clause. Of course, as we have seen, any reliance on that clause would be futile. But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.

In this connection special attention is due Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118. In that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds: (1) due process; (2) equal protection; and (3) the Guaranty Clause. But it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passage:
""The defendant company does not contend here that it could not have been required to pay a license tax. It does not assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to the amount for which it was taxed, or that there was anything inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law which violated any of its constitutional rights. If such questions had been raised they would have been justiciable, and therefore would have required the calling into operation of judicial power. Instead, however, of doing any of these things, the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly different character. Its essentially political nature is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the *228 framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form."" 223 U. S., at 150-151.The due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in Pacific States not because they happened to be joined with a Guaranty Clause claim, or because they sought to place before the Court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the Guaranty Clause, but because the Court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which, in its view, entailed political questions. Pacific States may be compared with cases such as Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219, wherein the Court refused to consider whether a workmen's compensation act violated the Guaranty Clause but considered at length, and rejected, due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it; and O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244, wherein the Court refused to consider whether Nebraska's delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the Guaranty Clause, but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose.

We conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought ""political,"" can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we *229 emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define ""political questions,"" and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization. Brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this.

When challenges to state action respecting matters of ""the administration of the affairs of the State and the officers through whom they are conducted""[55] have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction, this Court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim. For example, in Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, we reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision that Nebraska's Governor was not a citizen of the United States or of the State and therefore could not continue in office. In Kennard v. Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, 92 U. S. 480, and Foster v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, 112 U. S. 201, we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guaranty, and held on the merits that they had. And only last Term, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, we applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights, in the face of what a majority of the Court of Appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries.[56]

Gomillion was brought by a Negro who had been a resident of the City of Tuskegee, Alabama, until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the State Legislature *230 as to exclude practically all Negroes. The plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections. The District Court's dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. This Court unanimously reversed. This Court's answer to the argument that States enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries was:
""Legislative control of municipalities, no less than other state power, lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by the United States Constitution.. . . The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the achievement by a State of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions. `It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.' "" 364 U. S., at 344-345.To a second argument, that Colegrove v. Green, supra, was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case, the Court responded that Gomillion was lifted ""out of the so-called `political' arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation"" because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the Fifteenth Amendment.
""A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries. . . . While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of *231 their theretofore enjoyed voting rights. That was not Colegrove v. Green.
""When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right."" 364 U. S., at 347.[57]
We have not overlooked such cases as In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, and Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487, which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer. But these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction, and not upon federal courts' power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization. This is clear not only from the opinions in those cases, but also from White v. Berry, 171 U. S. 366, which, relying on Sawyer, withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer. Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a State's removal procedure, on the ground that the constitutional claim presentedthat a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirementswas frivolous. Finally, in Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548, where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of Kentucky's resolution of a contested gubernatorial election, the Court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon *232 the Guaranty Clause, holding it presented a political question, but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law.[58]

Since, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the District Court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable.

We have already noted that the District Court's holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon Colegrove v. Green, supra, and later cases. Some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature, as in this case; others, like Colegrove itself and earlier precedents, Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375, and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, concerned the choice of Representatives in the Federal Congress. Smiley, Koenig and Carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting. The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven Justices who participated in that decision. On the issue of justiciability, all four Justices comprising a majority relied upon Smiley v. Holm, but in two opinions, one for three Justices, 328 U. S., at 566, 568, and a separate one by Mr. Justice Rutledge, 328 U. S., at 564. The argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a ""political question"" the resolution of which was confided to Congress might have been rested upon Art. I,  4, Art. I,  5, Art. I,  2, and Amendment *233 XIV,  2. Mr. Justice Rutledge said: ""But for the ruling in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, I should have supposed that the provisions of the Constitution, Art. I,  4, that ""The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations . . .'; Art. I,  2 [but see Amendment XIV,  2], vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states `according to their respective Numbers'; and Art. I,  5, making each House the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members, would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter of degree. . . . Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think . . . that its effect is to rule that this Court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable."" 328 U. S., at 564-565. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable, although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed. His view was that ""The shortness of the time remaining [before forthcoming elections] makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. . . . I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause."" 328 U. S., at 565-566.[59]

*234 Article I,  2, 4, and 5, and Amendment XIV,  2, relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures. However, our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question. Indeed, the refusal to award relief in Colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity. Nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after Colegrove. This Court dismissed the appeals in Cook v. Fortson and Turman v. Duckworth, 329 U. S. 675, as moot. MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, held only that in that case equity would not act to void the State's requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees *235 for state-wide office, over at least a minimal area of the State. Problems of timing were critical in Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916, dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a three-judge court's dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought, 102 F. Supp. 708; and in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a three-judge court movants urged the Court to advance consideration of their case, ""Inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of . . . business may defeat the cause, and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case . . . ."" South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, like Colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equity's powers; see the statement of the holding, quoted, supra, p. 203. And Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state court's holding that their primary elections implicated no ""state action."" See 208 Ga. 498, 67 S. E. 2d 579. But compare Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.

Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state court's refusal to upset the districting of city council seats, especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting. See 43 So. 2d 514. Similarly, in Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ, original mandamus in the Supreme Court. That had been denied without opinion, and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this Court's review. And in Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar, but its holding rested on its state law of remedies, i. e., the state view of *236 de facto officers,[60] and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in Tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties. Of course this Court was there precluded by the adequate state ground, and in dismissing the appeal, 352 U. S. 920, we cited Anderson, supra, as well as Colegrove. Nor does the Tennessee court's decision in that case bear upon this, for just as in Smith v. Holm, 220 Minn. 486, 19 N. W. 2d 914, and Magraw v. Donovan, 163 F. Supp. 184, 177 F. Supp. 803, a state court's inability to grant relief does not bar a federal court's assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. Problems of relief also controlled in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991, affirming the District Court's refusal to mandamus the Governor to call a session of the legislature, to mandamus the legislature then to apportion, and if they did not comply, to mandamus the State Supreme Court to do so. And Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127, affirmed a refusal to strike down the State's gross income tax statuteurged on the ground that the legislature was malapportionedthat had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax, including challenges to its constitutionality. Lastly, Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, in which Mr. Justice Rutledge concurred in this Court's refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity, is sufficiently explained by his statement in Cook v. Fortson, supra: ""The discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction. . . in one case is not precedent in another case *237 where the facts differ."" 329 U. S., at 678, n. 8. (Citations omitted.)

We conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER did not participate in the decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.While I join the opinion of the Court and, like the Court, do not reach the merits, a word of explanation is necessary.[1] I put to one side the problems of ""political"" *242 questions involving the distribution of power between this Court, the Congress, and the Chief Executive. We have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies. More particularly, the question is the extent to which a State may weight one person's vote more heavily than it does another's.

So far as voting rights are concerned, there are large gaps in the Constitution. Yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution. The House and now the Senateare chosen by the people. The time, manner, and place of elections of Senators and Representatives are left to the States (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1; Amendment XVII) subject to the regulatory power of Congress. A ""republican form"" of government is guaranteed each State by Article IV, Section 4, and each is likewise promised protection against invasion.[2]Ibid. *243 That the States may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, which provides that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the *244 people and that ""the Electors (voters) in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors (voters) of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature."" The same provision, contained in the Seventeenth Amendment, governs the election of Senators. Within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law. See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U. S. 45, 50-51. Yet, as stated in Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 663-664, those who vote for members of Congress do not ""owe their right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the State."" The power of Congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here. It is, however, clear that by reason of the commands of the Constitution there are several qualifications that a State may not require.

Race, color, or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that alone is sufficient to explain Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. See Taper, Gomillion versus Lightfoot (1962), pp. 12-17.

Sex is another impermissible standard by reason of the Nineteenth Amendment.

There is a third barrier to a State's freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision invoked here. And so the question is, may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?

The traditional test under the Equal Protection Clause has been whether a State has made ""an invidious discrimination,"" as it does when it selects ""a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment."" See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541. Universal equality is not *245 the test; there is room for weighting. As we stated in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 489, ""The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.""

I agree with my Brother CLARK that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established. We are told that a single vote in Moore County, Tennessee, is worth 19 votes in Hamilton County, that one vote in Stewart or in Chester County is worth nearly eight times a single vote in Shelby or Knox County. The opportunity to prove that an ""invidious discrimination"" exists should therefore be given the appellants.

It is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts. Some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation. Yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination. Adjudication is often perplexing and complicated. An example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 665. The constitutional guide is often vague, as the decisions under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses show. The problem under the Equal Protection Clause is no more intricate. See Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1083-1084.

There are, of course, some questions beyond judicial competence. Where the performance of a ""duty"" is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer, the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other (Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 109), for to do so would be to take over the office. Cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 145.

*246 Where the Constitution assigns a particular function wholly and indivisibly[3] to another department, the federal judiciary does not intervene. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302. None of those cases is relevant here.

*247 There is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights. The Civil Rights Act gives them authority to redress the deprivation ""under color of any State law"" of any ""right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . ."" 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). And 28 U. S. C.  1343 (4) gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of ""any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote."" (Italics added.) The element of state action covers a wide range. For as stated in United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 326:
""Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken `under color of' state law."" And see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167.The right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by  1343 (4). Discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized (Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651) or struck down. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461. Fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some *248 have long been held to be within judicial cognizance. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371. The ""right to have one's vote counted"" whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 386, to be ""as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box."" See also United States v. Classic, supra, 324-325; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.

Chief Justice Holt stated in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 956 (a suit in which damages were awarded against election officials for not accepting the plaintiff's vote, 3 Ld. Raym. 320) that:
""To allow this action will make publick officers more careful to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the prejudice of the peace of the nation.""The same prophylactic effect will be produced here, as entrenched political regimes make other relief as illusory in this case as a petition to Parliament in Ashby v. White would have been.[4]

*249 Intrusion of the Federal Government into the election machinery of the States has taken numerous formsinvestigations (Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420); criminal proceedings (Ex parte Siebold, supra; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; United States v. Classic, supra); collection of penalties (Smith v. Allwright, supra); suits for declaratory relief and for an injunction (Terry v. Adams, supra); suits by the United States under the Civil Rights Act to enjoin discriminatory practices. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17.

As stated by Judge McLaughlin in Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220, 236 (an apportionment case in Hawaii which was reversed and dismissed as moot, 256 F. 2d 728):
""The whole thrust of today's legal climate is to end unconstitutional discrimination. It is ludicrous to preclude judicial relief when a mainspring of representative government is impaired. Legislators have no immunity from the Constitution. The legislatures of our land should be made as responsive to the Constitution of the United States as are the citizens who elect the legislators.""With the exceptions of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549; MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281; South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, and the decisions they spawned, the Court has never thought that protection of voting rights *250 was beyond judicial cognizance. Today's treatment of those cases removes the only impediment to judicial cognizance of the claims stated in the present complaint.

The justiciability of the present claims being established, any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of well-known principles of equity.[5]

*251
MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.One emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness. The Court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action. However, it refuses to award relief herealthough the facts are undisputed and fails to give the District Court any guidance whatever. One dissenting opinion, bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little, contemns the majority action as ""a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past."" Another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that Tennessee's apportionment is ""incorrect,"" ""arbitrary,"" ""obsolete,"" and ""unconstitutional."" I believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a State, that a patent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution has been shown, and that an appropriate remedy may be formulated.
I.I take the law of the case from MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281 (1948), which involved an attack under the Equal Protection Clause upon an Illinois election statute. The Court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the ""political question"" doctrine. Although the statute under attack was upheld, it is clear *252 that the Court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy. It stated:
""It would be strange indeed, and doctrinaire, for this Court, applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws, to deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former."" Id., at 284. (Emphasis supplied.)The other cases upon which my Brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite. The widely heralded case of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 (1946), was one not only in which the Court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion. Indeed, even the ""political question"" point in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion was no more than an alternative ground.[1] Moreover, the appellants did not present an equal protection argument.[2] While it has served as a Mother Hubbard to most of the subsequent cases, I feel it was in that respect illcast and for all of these reasons put it to one side.[3] Likewise, *253 I do not consider the Guaranty Clause cases based on Art. I,  4, of the Constitution, because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria, as the Court's opinion indicates. Cases resting on various other considerations not present here, such as Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991 (1957) (lack of equity); Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920 (1956) (adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment); Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912 (1952) (adequate state grounds); Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916 (1952) (failure to exhaust state procedures), are of course not controlling. Finally, the Georgia county-unit-system cases, such as South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276 (1950), reflect the viewpoint of MacDougall, i. e., to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the State's system.[4]
II.The controlling facts cannot be disputed. It appears from the record that 37% of the voters of Tennessee elect 20 of the 33 Senators while 40% of the voters elect 63 of the 99 members of the House. But this might not on its face be an ""invidious discrimination,"" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955), for a ""statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it."" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 426 (1961).

It is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in Tennessee's Constitution, i. e., state-wide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications,[5] is a rational one. On a county-by-county comparison *254 a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications. But this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems, for the overall policy is reasonable. However, the root of the trouble is not in Tennessee's Constitution, for admittedly its policy has not been followed. The discrimination lies in the action of Tennessee's Assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it. Try as one may, Tennessee's apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its Constitution. This was the finding of the District Court. The policy of the Constitution referred to by the dissenters, therefore, is of no relevance here. We must examine what the Assembly has done.[6] The frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever. An examination of Table I accompanying this opinion, post, p. 262, conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions. This is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained, but when the entire table is examinedcomparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger countiesit leaves but one conclusion, namely that Tennessee's apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis. At the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles I shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from Table I.

As is admitted, there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties. Some *255 samples are: Moore County has a total representation of two[7] with a population (2,340) of only one-eleventh of Rutherford County (25,316) with the same representation; Decatur County (5,563) has the same representation as Carter (23,303) though the latter has four times the population; likewise, Loudon County (13,264), Houston (3,084), and Anderson County (33,990) have the same representation, i. e., 1.25 each. But it is said that in this illustration all of the under-represented counties contain municipalities of over 10,000 population and they therefore should be included under the ""urban"" classification, rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a rural-urban political balance. But in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip, for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000, yet the same invidious discrimination is present. For example:


County
Population
Representation


Carter
23,303
1.10


Maury
24,556
2.25


Washington
36,967
1.93


Madison
37,245
3.50

*256

Likewise, counties with no municipality of over 10,000 suffer a similar discrimination:


County
Population
Representation


Grundy
6,540
0.95


Chester
6,391
2.00


Cumberland
9,593
0.63


Crockett
9,676
2.00


Loudon
13,264
1.25


Fayette
13,577
2.50

This could not be an effort to attain political balance between rural and urban populations. Since discrimination is present among counties of like population, the plan is neither consistent nor rational. It discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves,[8] still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban.

It is also insisted that the representation formula used above (see n. 7) is ""patently deficient"" because ""it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district."" This is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that ""the voice of every voter"" need not have ""approximate equality."" Indeed, representative government, as they say, is not necessarily one of ""bare numbers."" The use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population. His function is to represent the whole district. However, I shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its ""adjusted *257 `total representation' "" formula show that the present apportionment is loco. For example, compare some ""urban"" areas of like population, using the HARLAN formula:


County
Population
Representation


Washington
36,967
2.65


Madison
37,245
4.87



Carter
23,303

2.05


Maury
24,556
3.81


Coffee
13,406
2.32


Hamblen
14,090
1.07

And now, using the same formula, compare some so-called ""rural"" areas of like population:


County
Population

Moore
2,340
1.23


Pickett

These cannot be ""distorted effects,"" for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even ""a crazier"" quilt.

*258 The truth is thatalthough this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours' argument (three times the ordinary case) and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in Conference and individuallyno one, not even the State nor the dissenters, has come up with any rational basis for Tennessee's apportionment statute.

No oneexcept the dissenters advocating the HARLAN ""adjusted `total representation' "" formulacontends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the Equal Protection Clause. But certainly there must be some rational design to a State's districting. The discrimination here does not fit any patternas I have said, it is but a crazy quilt. My Brother HARLAN contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities. Instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants' proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy. Not being able to do this, he merely counters with such generalities as ""classic legislative judgment,"" no ""significant discrepancy,"" and ""de minimis departures."" I submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful. If present representation has a policy at all, it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost. Like the District Court, I conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing ""Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the [federal] rights of the plaintiffs. . . .""
III.Although I find the Tennessee apportionment statute offends the Equal Protection Clause, I would not consider intervention by this Court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of Tennessee. But the majority of the people of Tennessee have no *259 ""practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls"" to correct the existing ""invidious discrimination."" Tennessee has no initiative and referendum. I have searched diligently for other ""practical opportunities"" present under the law. I find none other than through the federal courts. The majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket. Tennessee has an ""informed, civically militant electorate"" and ""an aroused popular conscience,"" but it does not sear ""the conscience of the people's representatives."" This is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the Assembly to their respective constituencies, and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented. The people have been rebuffed at the hands of the Assembly; they have tried the constitutional convention route, but since the call must originate in the Assembly it, too, has been fruitless. They have tried Tennessee courts with the same result,[9] and Governors have fought the tide only to flounder. It is said that there is recourse in Congress and perhaps that may be, but from a practical standpoint this is without substance. To date Congress has never undertaken such a task in any State. We therefore must conclude that the people of Tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state government.
IV.Finally, we must consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief. The federal courts are of course not forums for political debate, nor should they *260 resolve themselves into state constitutional convention or legislative assemblies. Nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief. To my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the Assembly into reapportioning the State. If judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree, I would dismiss this appeal. However, like the Solicitor General of the United States, I see no such difficulty in the position of this case. One plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts, consolidate some of them, and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination. Other possibilities are present and might be more effective. But the plan here suggested would at least release the strangle hold now on the Assembly and permit it to redistrict itself.

In this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of state-wide equal representation. Not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a State is constitutionally required, I would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one. Nevertheless, the dissenters attack it by the application of the HARLAN ""adjusted `total representation' "" formula. The result is that some isolated inequalities are shown, but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the ""crazy quilt"" category. Such inequalities, as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational, are explainable. Moreover, there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application. Only where, as here, the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination.

*261 In view of the detailed study that the Court has given this problem, it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits. The majority appears to hold, at least sub silentio, that an invidious discrimination is present, but it remands to the three-judge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination. It is true that Tennessee has not filed a formal answer. However, it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position. At no time has it been able to contradict the appellants' factual claims; it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment; indeed, it has indicated that there are none known to it. As I have emphasized, the case proceeded to the point before the three-judge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present, and the State has not contested that holding here. In view of all this background I doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the State on remand, other than time. Nevertheless, not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits, I concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand. However, in fairness I do think that Tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed.

As John Rutledge (later Chief Justice) said 175 years ago in the course of the Constitutional Convention, a chief function of the Court is to secure the national rights.[10] Its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died, namely, that to be fully conformable to the principle of right, the form of government must be representative.[11] That is the keystone upon which our government was founded *262 and lacking which no republic can survive. It is well for this Court to practice self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time. National respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges. In my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this Court.

*265
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.The separate writings of my dissenting and concurring Brothers stray so far from the subject of today's decision as to convey, I think, a distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides. For that reason, I think it appropriate, in joining the opinion of the Court, to emphasize in a few words what the opinion does and does not say.

The Court today decides three things and no more: ""(a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) . . . that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes."" Ante, pp. 197-198.

The complaint in this case asserts that Tennessee's system of apportionment is utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. The District Court did not reach the merits of that claim, and this Court quite properly expresses no view on the subject. Contrary to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN, the Court does not say or imply that ""state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter."" Post, p. 332. The Court does not say or imply that there is anything in the Federal Constitution ""to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people."" Post, p. 334. And contrary to the suggestion of my Brother DOUGLAS, the Court most assuredly does not decide the question, ""may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?"" Ante, p. 244.

In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not ""deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative *266 as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former."" 335 U. S., at 284. In case after case arising under the Equal Protection Clause the Court has said what it said again only last Termthat ""the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others."" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425. In case after case arising under that Clause we have also said that ""the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it."" Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584.

Today's decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents. I repeat, the Court today decides only: (1) that the District Court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (2) that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy; (3) that the appellants have standing. My Brother CLARK has made a convincing prima facie showing that Tennessee's system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. My Brother HARLAN has, with imagination and ingenuity, hypothesized possibly rational bases for Tennessee's system. But the merits of this case are not before us now. The defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the State's system of apportionment; indeed, they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint. As in other cases, the proper place for the trial is in the trial court, not here.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.The Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected *267 only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representationa wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme. Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's ""judicial Power"" not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of ""the supreme Law of the Land"" in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court's authoritypossessed of neither the purse nor the swordultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.

A hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence. The claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the Court does not vouchsafe the lower courtsstate and federalguidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many States. In *268 such a setting, to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless. It is as devoid of reality as ""a brooding omnipresence in the sky,"" for it conveys no intimation what relief, if any, a District Court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary. For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd indeed an esotericconception of judicial propriety. One of the Court's supporting opinions, as elucidated by commentary, unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire (apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants) into which this Court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The Framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.

Recent legislation, creating a district appropriately described as ""an atrocity of ingenuity,"" is not unique. Considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every State, the Court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable *269 by courts.[*] Room continues to be allowed for weighting. This of course implies that geography, economics, urban-rural conflict, and all the other non-legal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments. To some extentaye, there's the rub. In effect, today's decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court's notion of what is proper districting.

We were soothingly told at the bar of this Court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a state-wide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric, because legislatures would heed the Court's admonition. This is not only a euphoric hope. It implies a sorry *270 confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgement that there is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legislative power. The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people's representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope.

This is the latest in the series of cases in which the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the States to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions.[1] The present action, which *271 comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory three-judge District Court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenges the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann., 1955  3-101 to 3-109, which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among Tennessee's ninety-five counties.

The original plaintiffs, citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the Tennessee Legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside, bring this action in their own behalf and ""on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee,"" or, as they alternatively assert, ""on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated."" The cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, and the Mayor of Nashvilleon his own behalf as a qualified voter and, pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the Nashville City Council, as a representative of all the city's residentswere permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.[2] The defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections.[3]

*272 The original plaintiffs' amended complaint avers, in substance, the following.[4] The Constitution of the State of Tennessee declares that ""elections shall be free and equal,"" provides that no qualifications other than age, citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage, and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime. Art. I,  5; Art. IV,  1. It requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each[5] at the time of each decennial *273 enumeration. Art. II,  4, 5, 6. Notwithstanding these provisions, the State Legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901. The Reapportionment Act of that year, Tenn. Acts 1901, c. 122, now Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109,[6] was unconstitutional when enacted, because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily, unequally and discriminatorily, as measured by the 1900 federal census. Moreover, irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901, it is asserted that the Act became ""unconstitutional and obsolete"" in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the Tennessee Constitution. Continuing a ""purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons,"" recent Tennessee Legislatures have failed, as did their predecessors, to enact reapportionment legislation, although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced. Because of population shifts since 1901, the apportionment fixed by the Act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population, denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs *274 live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled, and renders plaintiffs' votes ""not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts . . . ."" Plaintiffs ""suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect, arbitrary, obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the General Assembly . . . ,"" and the totality of the malapportionment's effectwhich permits a minority of about thirty-seven percent of the voting population of the State to control twenty of the thirty-three members of Tennessee's Senate, and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixty-three of the ninety-nine members of the Houseresults in ""a distortion of the constitutional system"" established by the Federal and State Constitutions, prevents the General Assembly ""from being a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee, . . ."" and is ""contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . ,"" and ""contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .""

Exhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain. Based upon ""approximate voting population,""[7] these set forth figures showing that the State *275 Senator from Tennessee's most populous senatorial district represents five and two-tenths times the number of voters represented by the Senator from the least populous district, while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous House districts is more than eighteen to one. The General Assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues, notably in the distribution of school and highway-improvement funds,[8] this discrimination being ""made possible and effective"" by the Legislature's failure to reapportion itself. Plaintiffs conclude that election of the State Legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 Act violates the Tennessee Constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the Act, an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109, until such time as the legislature is reapportioned ""according to the *276 Constitution of the State of Tennessee,"" and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the Tennessee Legislature on an at-large basisthe thirty-three senatorial candidates and the ninety-nine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected.[9]

Motions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted, 179 F. Supp. 824, the District Court relying upon this Court's series of decisions beginning with Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, rehearing denied, 329 U. S. 825, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, 329 U. S. 828. The original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal. 364 U. S. 898. In this Court they have altered their request for relief, suggesting a ""step-by-step approach."" The first step is a remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction, providing ""the necessary spur to legislative action . . . ."" If this proves insufficient, appellants will ask the ""additional spur"" of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 Act, or a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality, or both. Finally, all other means failing, the District Court is invited by the plaintiffs, greatly daring, to order an election at large or redistrict the State itself or through a master. The Solicitor General of the United States, who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal, asks the Court on this appeal to hold only that the District Court has ""jurisdiction"" and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statute's *277 constitutionality and of some undefined, unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found. After an argument at the last Term, the case was set down for reargument, 366 U. S. 907, and heard this Term.
I.In sustaining appellants' claim, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, that the District Court may entertain this suit, this Court's uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded. Explicitly it begins with Colegrove v. Green, supra, decided in 1946, but its roots run deep in the Court's historic adjudicatory process.

Colegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality, under the Equal Protection Clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions, of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the State's election of Representatives to the Congress. Two opinions were written by the four Justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the Court. Both opinions joining in the result in Colegrove v. Green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power. While the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations, there are important points of concurrence. Both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern, first, with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making; second, with respect to the difficultyin view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this countryof drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment, as opposed to legislative determinations, of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of *278 political power; and, third, with problems of finding appropriate modes of reliefparticularly, the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of at-large elections and elections held in districts of unequal population.

The broad applicability of these considerationssummarized in the loose shorthand phrase, ""political question"" in cases involving a State's apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the Court, since 1946, to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations. (In all these cases decision was by a full Court.) The ""political question"" principle as applied in Colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as ""one of the rules basic to the federal system and this Court's appropriate place within that structure."" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, 570. In Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, litigants brought suit in a Federal District Court challenging as offensive to the Equal Protection Clause Illinois' state legislative-apportionment laws. They pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population, alleged a failure to reapportion for more than forty-five yearsduring which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequaland sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter. After the complaint was dismissed by the District Court, this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. A similar District Court decision was affirmed here in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991. And cf. Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916. In Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, the Court declined to hear, for want of a substantial federal question, the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell *279 afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, rehearing denied, 343 U. S. 921, it found no substantial federal question raised by a state court's dismissal of a claim for damages for ""devaluation"" of plaintiff's vote by application of Georgia's county-unit system in a primary election for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The same Georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction; the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory three-judge court; and this Court, in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, 283, the Court noted that ""To assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,"" and, citing the Colegrove cases, declined to find in ""such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws,"" id., at 284, a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an Illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties. And in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, another suit attacking Georgia's county-unit law, it affirmed a District Court dismissal, saying
""Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions."" Id., at 277.Of course it is important to recognize particular, relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations. Appellants seek to distinguish several of this Court's prior decisions on one or another groundColegrove v. *280 Green on the ground that federal, not state, legislative apportionment was involved; Remmey v. Smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried; Radford v. Gary on the ground that Oklahoma has the initiative, whereas Tennessee does not. It would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases. Suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish Colegrove v. Barrett, supra, which is on all fours with the present case, or to distinguish Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920, in which the full Court without dissent, only five years ago, dismissed on authority of Colegrove v. Green and Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged. If the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected, appellants' claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the Colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.
II.The Colegrove doctrine, in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it, was not an innovation. It represents long judicial thought and experience. From its earliest opinions this Court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies. To classify the various instances as ""political questions"" is rather a form *281 of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis.[10] Some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here. But from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling.

1. The cases concerning war or foreign affairs, for example, are usually explained by the necessity of the country's speaking with one voice in such matters. While this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions,[11] others do not fit the pattern. It would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this Court to determine, in connection with private transactions between litigants, the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated. But the Court has refused to do so. See, e. g., The Protector, 12 Wall. 700; Brown v. Hiatts, 15 wall. 177; Adger v. Alston, 15 Wall. 555; Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 192-193. It does not suffice to explain such cases as Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the Presidential power to deport alien enemiesthat judicial intrusion would seriously *282 impede the President's power effectively to protect the country's interests in time of war. Of course, this is true; but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power. Cf. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19; Lamar v. Browne, 92 U. S. 187, 193; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146; Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U. S. 1. And even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of Indians, it is ordinarily for Congress, not the Court, to determine whether or not a particular Indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power.[12]E. g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28. A controlling factor in such cases is that, decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expediency, there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged. Where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants, the Court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments' decision of it. But where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power, the Court will not entertain the action. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman S. S. Corp., *283 333 U. S. 103. The dominant consideration is ""the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination . . . ."" Mr. Chief Jusice Hughes, for the Court, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. Compare United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, with Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.[13]

This may be, like so many questions of law, a matter of degree. Questions have arisen under the Constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines. Often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by, or the underlying presuppositions of, the Constitution. With respect to such questions, the Court has recognized that, concerning a particular power of Congress put in issue, "". . . effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes."" Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120. It is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of Indian tribes, referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the non-judicial branches, the Court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed. See United States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543. But this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind, and that, although within a certain range of cases on a continuum, no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them, other cases will fall above or below the range. The doctrine of political questions, like any other, is not to *284 be applied beyond the limits of its own logic, with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest. See the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of Colegrove v. Green and Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.

2. The Court has been particularly unwilling to intervene in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the States. The abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the Court's ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees. ""We should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case, and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts. The jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been . . . such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that if the judgment were suffered to remain, the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life, liberty or property in violation of the provisions of the Federal Constitution."" Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548; Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1. Cf. In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, 220-221.

Where, however, state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government, not in challenge of it, the Court has resolved such narrow, legally defined questions in proper proceedings. See Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135. In such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial *285 power. This distinction explains the decisions in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355; Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, in which the Court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements. Adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found. See McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, in which, in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits, the Court treated as justiciable the claim that a State could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts, but held that Art. II,  1, cl. 2, of the Constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the States. Cf. Pope v. Williams, 193 U. S. 621; Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U. S. 277. To read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the McPherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of ""justiciability"" derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case. In probing beneath the surface of cases in which the Court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government, of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene. Compare the reliance in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, on MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, and the ""jurisdictional"" form of the opinion in Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596, supra.

3. The cases involving Negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative. For here the controlling command of Supreme Law is plain and unequivocal. An end of discrimination against *286 the Negro was the compelling motive of the Civil War Amendments. The Fifteenth expresses this in terms, and it is no less true of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 67-72; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 306-307; Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 541. Thus the Court, in cases involving discrimination against the Negro's right to vote, has recognized not only the action at law for damages,[14] but, in appropriate circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief.[15]Schnell v. Davis, 336 U. S. 933; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.[16] Injunctions in these cases, it should be noted, would not have restrained state-wide general elections. Compare Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475.

4. The Court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on ""abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government."" Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485. See Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 258 U. S. 158, 162; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328, 337. The ""political question"" doctrine, in this aspect, reflects the policies underlying the requirement of ""standing"": that the litigant who would challenge official *287 action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself, as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of governmenta complaint that the political institutions are awry. See Stearns v. Wood, 236 U. S. 75; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89-91. What renders cases of this kind non-justiciable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them, for the Court has resolved other issues between similar parties;[17] nor is it the nature of the legal question involved, for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy.[18] The crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in non-judicial forums, by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade. See Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700; White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646; Phillips v. Payne, 92 U. S. 130; Marsh v. Burroughs, 1 Woods 463, 471-472 (Bradley, Circuit Justice); cf. Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U. S. 24; but see Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. Thus, where the Cherokee Nation sought by an original motion to restrain the State of Georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated Cherokee territory to the State's counties, abrogated Cherokee law, and abolished Cherokee government, the Court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1.[19] And in Georgia *288 v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the State of Georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the Constitution:[20]
""That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill; and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of persons or property, but of a political character, will hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence as a State, with all its constitutional powers and privileges. No case of private rights or private property infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement, is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the judgment of the court."" Id., at 77.[21]
*289 5. The influence of these converging considerations the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking, the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate, the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is ill-adaptedhas been decisive of the settled line of cases, reaching back more than a century, which holds that Art. IV,  4, of the Constitution, guaranteeing to the States ""a Republican Form of Government,""[22] is not enforceable through the courts. E. g., O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219; Cochran v. Board of Education, 281 U. S. 370; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608.[23] Claims resting on this specific *290 guarantee of the Constitution have been held nonjusticiable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74, state delegation of power to municipalities, Kiernan v. Portland, Oregon, 223 U. S. 151, state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569, and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment, Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250, 256-257. The subject was fully considered in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, in which the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state license-tax statute enacted by the initiative, on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a Republican Form of Government and violated the Equal Protection Clause and other federal guarantees. After nothing "". . . the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction *291 to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for,""[24] the Court said:
"". . . [The] essentially political nature [of this claim] is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion *292 has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form."" Id., at 150-151.The starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is, of course, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1. The case arose out of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1841-1842. Rhode Island, at the time of the separation from England, had not adopted a new constitution but had continued, in its existence as an independent State, under its original royal Charter, with certain statutory alterations. This frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law; the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation, which limited it to freeholders. In the 1830's, largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates, dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government. In addition, population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence, even among qualified voters. The towns felt themselves underrepresented, and agitation began for electoral reform. When the charter government failed to respond, popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution. This constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage (with certain qualifications); and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained. This new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention, but the government elected and organized under it, with Dorr at its head, never came to power. The *293 charter government denied the validity of the convention, the constitution and its government and, after an insignificant skirmish, routed Dorr and his followers. It meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention, which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 1843.[25]

Luther v. Borden was a trespass action brought by one of Dorr's supporters in a United States Circuit Court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house. The defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government, and plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the Dorr constitution. Evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the Dorr government was the rightful government of Rhode Island was rejected by the Circuit Court; the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful; and on a verdict for defendants, plaintiff brought a writ of error to this Court.

The Court, through Mr. Chief Justice Taney, affirmed. After noting that the issue of the charter government's legality had been resolved in that government's favor by the state courts of Rhode Islandthat the state courts, deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination, had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter governmentthe Chief Justice held that the courts of the United States must follow those of the State in this regard. Id., at 39-40. It was recognized that the compulsion to follow *294 state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the Federal Constitution, ibid., but no such command was found. The Constitution, the Court saidreferring to the Guarantee Clause of the Fourth Article"". . . as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind, and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department."" Id., at 42.
""Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head, Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts."" Ibid.[26]
*295 In determining this issue non-justiciable, the Court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed. It adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government.[27] It acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to non-judicial processes,[28] and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision.[29] The absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical, for the question whether the Dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended, in part, upon the extent of the franchise to be recognizedthe very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought.
"". . . [I]f the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution, unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges *296 the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision."" Id., at 41.Mr. Justice Woodbury (who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law) agreed with the Court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issues:
""But, fortunately for our freedom from political excitements in judicial duties, this court can never with propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political. The adjustment of these questions belongs to the people and their political representatives, either in the State or general government. These questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles. They are adjusted rather by inclination,or prejudice or compromise, often. Some of them succeed or are defeated even by public policy alone, or mere naked power, rather than intrinsic right. . . .""Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges would be, that in such an event all political privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the people, depend on our decision finally. . . . [D]isputed points in making constitutions, depending often, as before shown, on policy, inclination, popular resolves, and popular will, . . . if the people, in the distribution of powers under the constitution, should ever think of making judges supreme arbiters in political controversies, when not selected by nor, frequently, amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow such various considerations in their judgments as belong to mere political questions, they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in this way slowly, but surelya new sovereign power in the *297 republic, in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times. . . ."" Id., at 51-53.[30]
III.The present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. But it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the Fourteenth Amendment rather than Art. IV,  4, where, in fact, the gist of their complaint is the sameunless it can be found that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation. We have been admonished to avoid ""the tyranny of labels."" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 114. Art. IV,  4, is not committed by express constitutional terms to Congress. It is the nature of the controversies arising under it, nothing else, which has made it judicially unenforceable. Of course, if a controversy falls within judicial power, it depends ""on how he [the plaintiff] casts his action,"" Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U. S. 656, 662, whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute. But where judicial competence is wanting, it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the Constitution rather than another. When what was essentially a Guarantee Clause claim was sought to be laid, as well, under the Equal Protection Clause in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, supra, the Court had no difficulty in ""dispelling *298 any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression and considering the substance of things . . . ."" 223 U. S., at 140.

Here appellants attack ""the State as a State,"" precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the Pacific States case, id., at 150. Their complaint is that the basis of representation of the Tennessee Legislature hurts them. They assert that ""a minority now rules in Tennessee,"" that the apportionment statute results in a ""distortion of the constitutional system,"" that the General Assembly is no longer ""a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee,"" all ""contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . ."" Accepting appellants' own formulation of the issue, one can know this handsaw from a hawk. Such a claim would be non-justiciable not merely under Art. IV,  4, but under any clause of the Constitution, by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate. Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra.

But appellants, of course, do not rest on this claim simpliciter. In invoking the Equal Protection Clause, they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them, by way of ""a debasement of their votes . . . ."" Does this characterization, with due regard for the facts from which it is derived, add anything to appellants' case?[31]

At first blush, this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of *299 a more private, less impersonal claim, than the assertion that the frame of government is askew. Appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class, in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety. However, the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence. This, of course, is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government. Hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government non-republican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups, and to the advantage of others, within the body politic. It would be ingenuous not to see, or consciously blind to deny, that the real battle over the initiative and referendum, or over a delegation of power to local rather than state-wide authority, is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given. No shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society.

What, then, is this question of legislative apportionment? Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted.[32] But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state *300 councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerfulin short, that Tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied. Talk of ""debasement"" or ""dilution"" is circular talk. One cannot speak of ""debasement"" or ""dilution"" of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth. What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representationultimately, really, among competing theories of political philosophyin order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the State of Tennessee and thereby for all the States of the Union.

In such a matter, abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities; they betray reason. This is not a case in which a State has, through a device however oblique and sophisticated, denied Negroes or Jews or redheaded persons a vote, or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote. That was Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. What Tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representationrepresentation by local geographical division, only in part respective of populationin preference to others, others, forsooth, more appealing. Appellants contest this choice and seek to make this Court the arbiter of the disagreement. They would make the Equal Protection Clause the charter of adjudication, asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports, if not the assurance of equal weight to every voter's vote, at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population, a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged.

To find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. See Luther v. Borden, supra. Certainly, ""equal protection"" is no more secure *301 a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is ""Republican Form."" Indeed since ""equal protection of the laws"" can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged, the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship. This, with respect to apportionment, means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state. For a court could not determine the equal-protection issue without in fact first determining the Republican-Form issue, simply because what is reasonable for equal-protection purposes will depend upon what frame of government, basically, is allowed. To divorce ""equal protection"" from ""Republican Form"" is to talk about half a question.

The notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the Fourteenth Amendmentthat it is, in appellants' words ""the basic principle of representative government""is, to put it bluntly, not true. However desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government, it has never been generally practiced, today or in the past. It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today. Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitutionviews which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of *302 involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversiesthe Fourteenth Amendment, ""itself a historical product,"" Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 31, provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.
1. Great Britain.Writing in 1958, Professor W. J. M. Mackenzie aptly summarized the British history of the principle of representation proportioned to population: "" `Equal electoral districts' formed part of the programme of radical reform in England in the 1830s, the only part of that programme which has not been realised.""[33] Until the late nineteenth century, the sole base of representation (with certain exceptions not now relevant) was the local geographical unit: each county or borough returned its fixed number of members, usually two for the English units, regardless of population.[34] Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers, which had grown to significant size at the advent of the Industrial Revolution and had not been granted borough representation, and by the existence of the rotten borough, playing its substantial part in the Crown's struggle for continued control of the Commons.[35] In 1831, ten southernmost English counties, numbering three and a quarter million people, had two hundred and thirty-five parliamentary representatives, while the six northernmost counties, with more than three and a half million people, had sixty-eight.[36] It was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and *303 fifty members in the Commons.[37] Less than a half century earlier, Madison in the Federalist had remarked that half the House was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of England and Scotland.[38]

The Act of 1832, the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation,[39] effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system. It did not adopt the principle of representation based on population, but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centersstill quite without regard to their relative numbers.[40] In the wake of the Act there remained substantial electoral inequality: the boroughs of Cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily, judged by population, as the county's eastern division; the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions; Honiton, with about three thousand inhabitants, was equally represented with Liverpool, which had four hundred thousand.[41] In 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the House, but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867, although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly, gauged by the population standard.[42] Population shifts increased the surviving inequalities; by 1884 the representation ratio *304 in many small boroughs was more than twenty-two times that of Birmingham or Manchester, forty-to-one disparities could be found elsewhere, and, in sum, in the 1870's and 1880's, a fourth of the electorate returned two-thirds of the members of the House.[43]

The first systematic English attempt to distribute seats by population was the Redistribution Act of 1885.[44] The statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one,[45] which had increased to fifteen to one by 1912.[46] In 1918 Parliament again responded to ""shockingly bad"" conditions of inequality,[47] and to partisan political inspiration,[48] by redistribution.[49] In 1944, redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act of that year,[50] which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the Commons to administrative agencies (Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively).[51] The Commissions, having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance, are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the Home Secretary's submission to Parliament, along with the draft of an Order in Council to give effect to the *305 Commissions' recommendations. The districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population, although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable, and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions, including the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies. Under the original 1944 Act, the rules provided that (subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the House of Commons as prescribed by the Act) so far as practicable, the single-member districts should not deviate more than twenty-five percent from the electoral quota (population divided by number of constituencies). However, apparently at the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England, the twenty-five percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947, and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable, a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries.[52] Free of the twenty-five percent rule, the Commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run, in ordinary cases, as high as two to one and, in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies, three to one.[53] The action of the Boundary Commission for England was twice challenged in the courts in 1954the claim being that the Commission had violated statutory rules *306 prescribing the standards for its judgmentand in both cases the Judges declined to intervene. In Hammersmith Borough Council v. Boundary Commission for England,[54] Harman, J., was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the Acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference, and in Harper v. Home Secretary,[55] the Court of Appeal, per Evershed, M. R., quoting Harman, J., with approval, adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the Commission under the Acts, and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court, reached the same conclusion.[56]

The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958,[57] made two further amendments to the law. Responsive to the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England,[58] the interval permitted between Commission reports was more than doubled, to a new maximum of fifteen years.[59] And at the suggestion of the same Commission that ""It would ease the future labours of the Commission and remove much local irritation if Rule 5 [requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable] were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent *307 with the broad intention of the Rules,""[60] the Commissions were directed to consider the inconvenience attendant upon the alteration of constituencies, and the local ties which such alteration might break. The Home Secretary's view of this amendment was that it worked to erect ""a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.""[61]
2. The Colonies and the Union.For the guiding political theorists of the Revolutionary generation, the English system of representation, in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality, was a model to be avoided, not followed.[62] Nevertheless, the basic English principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities, towns or counties, rather than among units of approximately equal population, had early taken root in the colonies.[63] In some, as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, numbers of electors were taken into account, in a rough fashion, by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population, but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers.[64] This resulted in grossly unequal electoral units.[65] The representation ratio in one North Carolina county was more than eight times that in another.[66] Moreover, American rotten boroughs had appeared,[67] and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political *308 struggles between the King or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures,[68] and, later, between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior.[69] Madison in the Philadelphia Convention adverted to the ""inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, . . .""[70] arguing that it was necessary to confer on Congress the power ultimately to regulate the times, places and manner of selecting Representatives,[71] in order to forestall the overrepresented counties' securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils. The example of South Carolina, where Charleston's overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country, was cited by Madison in the Virginia Convention and by King in the Massachusetts Convention, in support of the same power, and King also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from Connecticut's town-representation system.[72]

Such inequalities survived the constitutional period. The United States Constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers. Apportionment of the national legislature among the States was one of the most difficult problems for the Convention;[73] its solution involving State representation in the Senate[74] and the three-fifths compromise in the House[75]left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population. *309 Within the States, electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater.[76] Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, recorded the ""very unequal"" representation there: individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives, and those nineteen thousand of Virginia's fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the State's senators and almost half its delegates.[77] In South Carolina in 1790, the three lower districts, with a white population of less than twenty-nine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members; while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fifty-four assemblymen.[78]

In the early nineteenth century, the demands of the interior became more insistent. The apportionment quarrel in Virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829. Bitter animosities racked the convention, threatening the State with disunion. At last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators, as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixty-three thousand people of the east, commanded agreement. It was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the State of Maryland.[79]

Maryland, however, had her own numerical disproportions. In 1820, one representative vote in Calvert County *310 was worth five in Frederick County, and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members, while fifty thousand others elected twenty.[80] This was the result of the county-representation system of allotment. And, except for Massachusetts which, after a long struggle, did adopt representation by population at the mid-century, a similar town-representation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout New England, with all its attendant, often gross inequalities.[81]
3. The States at the time of ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and those later admitted. The several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation.[82] Their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees. Particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the States with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirty-three States which ratified the Amendment between 1866 and 1870, at their respective times of ratification. These may be considered in two groups: (A) the ratifying States other than the ten Southern States whose constitutions, at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter, were the work of the Reconstruction Act conventions;[83] and *311 (B) the ten Reconstruction-Act States. All thirty-three are significant, because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying States could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice, and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the Equal Protection Clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment whichif appellants' argument is soundstruck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions. But the constitutions of the ten Reconstruction-Act States have an added importance, for it is scarcely to be thought that the Congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel States to Congress turn on their respective ratifications of it, would have approved constitutions whichagain, under appellants' theorycontemporaneously offended the Amendment.
A. Of the twenty-three ratifying States of the first group, seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population,[84] unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries.[85] Three *312 more apportioned on what was essentially a population base, but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratioa moiety or two-thirds should have a representative.[86] Since each of these three States limited the size of their chambers, the fractional rule could operateand, at least in Michigan, has in fact operated[87]to produce substantial numerical inequalities *313 in favor of the sparsely populated counties.[88] Iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district,[89] and New York and Kansas compromised population and county-representation principles by assuring every county, regardless of the number of its inhabitants, at least one seat in their respective Houses.[90]

Ohio and Maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device. The former gave a House representative to each county having half a ratio, two representatives for a ratio and three-quarters, three representatives for three ratios, and a single additional representative for each additional ratio.[91] The latter, after apportioning among counties on a population base, gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative, each town of three thousand, seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives, and so on in increasing intervals to twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty inhabitants towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives: seven.[92] The departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent: in Maine, assuming the incidence of towns in *314 all categories, representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one, at a minimum. Similarly, Missouri gave each of its counties, however small, one representative, two representatives for three ratios, three representatives for six ratios, and one additional representative for each three ratios above six.[93] New Hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure;[94] its Senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid.[95] In Pennsylvania, the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants; and in the House every county of at least thirty-five hundred taxables had a representative, nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district; while in the Senate no city or county could have more than four of the State's twenty-five to thirty-three senators.[96]

Finally, four States apportioned at least one House with no regard whatever to population. In Connecticut[97] and Vermont[98] representation in the House was on a town basis; Rhode Island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities,[99] and New Jersey, one to each of its counties.[100]*315 Nor, in any of these States, was the other House apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers: Connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators[101] and Vermont, one;[102] New Jersey assured each county a representative;[103] and in Rhode Island, which gave at least one representative to each town or city, no town or city could have more than one-sixth of the total number in the House.[104]
B. Among the ten late Confederate States affected by the Reconstruction Acts, in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population.[105] In North Carolina,[106] South Carolina,[107] Louisiana,[108] and Alabama,[109] each county (in the case of Louisiana, each parish) was assured at least one seat in the lower House irrespective of numbersa distribution which exhausted, respectively, *316 on the basis of the number of then-existing counties, three-quarters, one-quarter, two-fifths and three-fifths of the maximum possible number of representatives, before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis; and in South Carolina, moreover, the Senate was composed of one member elected from each county, except that Charleston sent two.[110] In Florida's House, each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives;[111] while Georgia, whose Senate seats were distributed among forty-four single-member districts each composed of three contiguous counties,[112] assigned representation in its House as follows: three seats to each of the six most populous counties, two to each of the thirty-one next most populous, one to each of the remaining ninety-five.[113] As might be expected, the one-representative-per-county minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality,[114] and Georgia's *317 county-clustering system has produced representative-ratio disparities, between the largest and smallest counties, of more than sixty to one.[115]
C.
The constitutions[116] of the thirteen States which Congress admitted to the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment showed a similar pattern. Six of them required or permitted apportionment of both Houses by population, subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries.[117] Wyoming, apportioning by population, guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each House,[118] and Idaho, which prescribed (after the first legislative session) that apportionment should be ""as may be provided by law,"" gave each county at least one representative.[119] In Oklahoma, House members were apportioned among counties so as to give one *318 seat for half a ratio, two for a ratio and three-quarters, and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county.[120] Montana required reapportionment of its House on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law[121] but its counties were represented as counties in the Senate, each county having one senator.[122] Alaska[123] and Hawaii[124] each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts; their respective Houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population, subject to a moiety rule in Alaska[125] and to Hawaii's guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas.[126] The Arizona Constitution assigned representation to each county in each house, giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each, and making no provision for reapportionment.[127]

*319 4. Contemporary apportionment. Detailed recent studies are available to describe the present-day constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty States.[128] They demonstrate a decided twentieth-century trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation. Today, only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard,[129] and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber. ""Specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century. . . .""[130] More than twenty States now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population, and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch, whatever the number of each unit's inhabitants. Of course, numerically considered, ""These provisions invariably result in over-representation of the least populated areas. . . .""[131] And in an effort to curb the political dominance of metropolitan regions, at least ten States now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county (or, in some cases, city) *320 in one legislative houseanother source of substantial numerical disproportion.[132]

Moreover, it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date, even where state constitutions in terms require it.[133] In particular, the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural, relatively sparsely populated areasthe same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions,[134] and which has been given effect in England and elsewhere[135]has, in some of the States, been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of *321 population shifts.[136] Throughout the country, urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas.[137]

The stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature, that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard.[138] Examples could be endlessly multiplied. In New Jersey, counties of *322 thirty-five thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator.[139] Representative districts in Minnesota range from 7,290 inhabitants to 107,246 inhabitants.[140] Ratios of senatorial representation in California vary as much as two hundred and ninety-seven to one.[141] In Oklahoma, the range is ten to one for House constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for Senate constituencies.[142] Colebrook, Connecticutpopulation 592elects two House representatives; Hartfordpopulation 177,397also elects two.[143] The first, third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment; the second is the result of legislative inaction; the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources. A survey made in 1955, in sum, reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a House majority in thirteen States and a Senate majority in nineteen States.[144] These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality. They show that there is notas there has never beena standard by *323 which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured.

Manifestly, the Equal Protection Clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the Guarantee Clause itself. Apportionment, by its character, is a subject of extraordinary complexity, involvingeven after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised considerations of geography, demography, electoral convenience, economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups, communications, the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine, ancient traditions and ties of settled usage, respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status, mathematical mechanics, censuses compiling relevant data, and a host of others.[145]*324 Legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 Census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit. And this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated, intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics.[146] The practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it. Apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intra-party contests.[147] It will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federal-state relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them.[148]
*325
IV.Appellants, however, contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the Fourteenth Amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee. The argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in States where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions, the Tennessee Legislature may not abridge the rights which, on its face, its own constitution appears to give, without by that act denying equal protection of the laws. It is said that the law of Tennessee, as expressed by the words of its written constitution, has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population, and that it is no longer open to the State to allot its voting power on other principles.

This reasoning does not bear analysis. Like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason. It is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the *326 State's fundamental law. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362. And see Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674; Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 196 U. S. 599, 608-609; Owensboro Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, 200 U. S. 38; Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316-317; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. Appellants complain of a practice which, by their own allegations, has been the law of Tennessee for sixty years. They allege that the Apportionment Act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts. They allege that the Legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts. And the Supreme Court of Tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40; appeal dismissed here in 352 U. S. 920. In these circumstances, what was said in the Browning case, supra, at 369, clearly governs this case:
"". . . Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic, unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for the first time. It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause is not a command of candor. . . .""*327 Tennessee's law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be, not what appellants cull from the unenforced and, according to its own judiciary, unenforceable words of its Constitution. The statute comes here on the same footing, therefore, as would the apportionment laws of New Jersey, California or Connecticut,[149] and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely.[150]

In another aspect, however, the Kidd v. McCanless case, supra, introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation, which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction. In all of the apportionment cases which have come before the Court, a consideration which has been weighty in determining their non-justiciability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case. An injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a State's political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable. A declaration devoid *328 of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat.[151] Surely a Federal District Court could not itself remap the State: the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a court's consideration of these imponderables as an original matter. And the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district, however unequal the districts, is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications, the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of, and capacity for appraisal by, courts.

In Tennessee, moreover, the McCanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief. That case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 Reapportionment Act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the Act's enforcement or, alternatively, a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large, or, again alternatively, a decree of the court reapportioning the State. The Chancellor denied all coercive relief, but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment. It was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected, that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion, and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government. The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted; in particular, it said, ""There is no provision of law for election of our General Assembly by an election at large over the State."" 200 Tenn., at 277, 292 S. W. 2d, at 42. Thus, a legislature elected at *329 large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the State. The court reversed, however, the Chancellor's determination to give declaratory relief, holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained:
""(4) It seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the Act of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of the General Assembly in office. If the Chancellor is correct in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of the decade following its enactment then for the same reason all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of time and are non-existent. Therefore we would not only not have any existing members of the General Assembly but we would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new election could be held for the election of members to the General Assembly......""The ultimate result of holding this Act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present Legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the State itself."" 200 Tenn., at 281-282, 292 S. W. 2d, at 44.A federal court enforcing the Federal Constitution is not, to be sure, bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts. But it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those state-law effects of its decree which it cannot itself control. A federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the State of Tennessee. And it cannot be doubted that the striking *330 down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds, no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially, would deprive the State of all valid apportionment legislation andunder the ruling in McCanlessdeprive the State of an effective law-based legislative branch. Just such considerations, among others here present, were determinative in Luther v. Borden and the Oregon initiative cases.[152]

Although the District Court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim, the case is of that class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action. The judgment of the District Court, in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, should therefore be affirmed.
Dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins.The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, in which I join, demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concernsan area which, in this instance, the Tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter.

It does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds, though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains, has a tendency, because of variants in expression, to becloud analysis in a given case. With due respect to the majority, I think that has happened here.

Once one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to ""jurisdiction,"" ""standing,"" ""justiciability,"" and ""political *331 question,"" there emerges a straightforward issue which, in my view, is determinative of this case. Does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right, in other words, a claim over which a United States District Court would have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) and 42 U. S. C.  1983? The majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question, but, as one concurring Justice observes, seems to decide it ""sub silentio."" Ante, p. 261. However, in my opinion, appellants' allegations, accepting all of them as true, do not, parsed down or as a whole, show an infringement by Tennessee of any rights assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I believe the complaint should have been dismissed for ""failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 12 (b) (6).

It is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is. The issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal House of Representatives are allocated, but solely to the right of a State to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature. Until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what Tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of ""justiciability"" or ""political question"" or any of the other considerations which in such cases as Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, led the Court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal House of Representatives, in the absence of a controlling Act of Congress. See also Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1.

The appellants' claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is asserted that Tennessee has violated the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining in effect a *332 system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the State as against its urban communities. Stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth:
(1) The Equal Protection Clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight.(2) Short of this, the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the Tennessee Legislature, which is offensive to the Equal Protection Clause.(3) In any event, the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it flies in the face of the Tennessee Constitution.For reasons given in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion, ante, pp. 325-327, the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable, and need not be dealt with further. I turn to the other two.
I.I can find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not only is that proposition refuted by history, as shown by my Brother FRANKFURTER, but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern.

*333 In the last analysis, what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government. It is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account. The existence of the United States Senate is proof enough of that. To consider that we may ignore the Tennessee Legislature's judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed. Hence we must accept the present form of the Tennessee Legislature as the embodiment of the State's choice, or, more realistically, its compromise, between competing political philosophies. The federal courts have not been empowered by the Equal Protection Clause to judge whether this resolution of the State's internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable, wise or unwise.

With respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures, for example, it has been said that the ""day is gone when this Court uses the . . . Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws . . . because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought."" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488. I would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of self-restraint when what is involved is the freedom of a State to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch. The Federal Constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the United States the duty to guarantee to every State ""a Republican Form of Government."" And, as my Brother FRANKFURTER so conclusively proves (ante, pp. 308-317), no intention to fix immutably the *334 means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the Founders or the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In short, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people. I would have thought this proposition settled by MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, in which the Court observed (at p. 283) that to ""assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,"" and reaffirmed by South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276. A State's choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units, rather than according to a census of population, is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income. Both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this Court.
II.The claim that Tennessee's system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis.

The Court has said time and again that the Equal Protection Clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality. E. g., Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 527-528, and authorities there cited; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425-426. All that is prohibited is ""invidious discrimination"" bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the State. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 489. And in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a State, it must be borne in mind that a ""statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived *335 to justify it."" McGowan v. Maryland, supra. It is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality; only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this Court condemn it.

What then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy? It is not that Tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented. Nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice, or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment. Rather, the claim is that the State Legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901, refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime.

It is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid, in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in Art. II,  5, of the Tennessee Constitution. In support of this the appellants have furnished a Table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented. But that Table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy; in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added. And it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the Tennessee Constitution was in some *336 instances slightly disregarded. Unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance, these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, they show the contrary.

Thus reduced to its essentials, the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the Tennessee Legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived.

A Federal District Court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment. But is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment? Surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation, or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature.

Indeed, I would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislature's expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the State's agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities. A State may, after all, take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens, e. g., American Sugar Rfg. Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89, and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation, e. g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388; Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31. Even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the Equal Protection Clause. *337 Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141. Does the Fourteenth Amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a State's apportionment of political representatives to its central government? I think not. These are matters of local policy, on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment.

The suggestion of my Brother FRANKFURTER that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this, is relevant not only to the question of ""justiciability,"" but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case. Courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment. And so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment, such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the Fourteenth Amendment affords. Certainly, with all due respect, the facile arithmetical argument contained in Part II of my Brother CLARK'S separate opinion (ante, pp. 253-258) provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)

These conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the Tennessee legislators, in refusing to consider reapportionment, had been actuated by self-interest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives. Since Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, was decided many years ago, it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators. E. g., Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 & n. 7. The function of the federal judiciary ends in *338 matters of this kind once it appears, as I think it does here on the undisputed facts, that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)

It is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint. Indeed, it is interesting to note that my Brother STEWART is at pains to disclaim for himself, and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest, that the Federal Constitution requires of the States any particular kind of electoral apportionment, still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength. Concurring opinion, ante, p. 265. But that being so, what, may it be asked, is left of this complaint? Surely the bare allegations that the existing Tennessee apportionment is ""incorrect,"" ""arbitrary,"" ""obsolete"" and ""unconstitutional""amounting to nothing more than legal conclusionsdo not themselves save the complaint from dismissal. See Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651. Nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute; as is so correctly emphasized by my Brother STEWART (ante, p. 266), this Court has consistently held in cases arising under the Equal Protection Clause that "" `the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584."" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion, which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute. And finally, the majority's failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the Federal Constitutionan issue necessarily presented by appellees' motion to dismiss *339 does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial.

From a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision. The fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the Court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention. While the Equal Protection Clause is invoked, the opinion for the Court notably eschews explaining how, consonant with past decisions, the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision. The majority seems to have accepted the argument, pressed at the bar, that if this Court merely asserts authority in this field, Tennessee and other ""malapportioning"" States will quickly respond with appropriate political action, so that this Court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters. At the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled. Thus, what the Court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication. Whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or, as is suggested in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682-683, for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the judgment of the District Court was correct.

In conclusion, it is appropriate to say that one need not agree, as a citizen, with what Tennessee has done or failed to do, in order to deprecate, as a judge, what the majority is doing today. Those observers of the Court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice, no matter what its nature or source, will no doubt applaud this decision and its break *340 with the past. Those who consider that continuing national respect for the Court's authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, will view the decision with deep concern.

I would affirm.
APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.THE INADEQUACY OF ARITHMETICAL FORMULAS AS MEASURES OF THE RATIONALITY OF TENNESSEE'S APPORTIONMENT.Two of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the Equal Protection Clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the State Legislature. Whether the existing Tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find ""any possible justification in rationality"" (ante, p. 265); it is to be struck down only if ""the discrimination here does not fit any pattern"" (ante, p. 258).

One of the concurring opinions, that of my Brother STEWART, suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary. The same is true of the majority opinion. My Brother CLARK, on the other hand, concludes that ""the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions"" (ante, p. 254), solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive Table appended thereto. In my view, that analysis is defective not only because the ""total representation"" formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion (ante, p. 255), rests on faulty mathematical foundations, but, more basically, because the approach taken wholly *341 ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a State Legislature.

In failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which, as will be shown, is patently unsound, my Brother CLARK'S opinion has, I submit, unwittingly served to bring into bas-relief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted. For in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a court, in line with well-established constitutional doctrine, must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalities.
I.At the outset, it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the Tennessee Constitution are rational. These rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations: (1) to utilize counties as electoral units; (2) to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts; (3) to allot to each county that has a substantial voting populationat least two-thirds of the average voting population per countya separate ""direct representative""; (4) to create ""floterial"" districts (multicounty representative districts) made up of more than one county; and (5) to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties.[1] Such a framework unavoidably *342 leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties' ""total representation"" is sought to be measured. It particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my Brother CLARK'S opinion is applied.

That formula computes a county's ""total representation"" by adding (1) the number of ""direct representatives"" the county is entitled to elect; (2) a fraction of any other seats in the Tennessee House which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a ""floterial district""; (3) triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone; and (4) triple a fraction of any seats in the Tennessee Senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district. The fractions used for items (2) and (4) are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the House or Senate seat, regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district.[2]

*343 This formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district. As a result, the formula unrealistically assigns to Moore County one-third of a senator, in addition to its direct representative (ante, p. 255), although it must be obvious that Moore's voting strength in the Eighteenth Senatorial District is almost negligible. Since Moore County could cast only 2,340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30,478 in the senatorial district, it should in truth be considered as represented by one-fifteenth of a senator. Assuming, arguendo, that any ""total representation"" figure is of significance, Moore's ""total representation"" should be 1.23, not 2.[3]

The formula suggested by my Brother CLARK must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks, as I assuredly do not, that the Federal Constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight. The correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life. It may, of course, be true that the floterial representative's ""function *344 is to represent the whole district"" (ante, p. 256). But can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a county-unit system, in which each county casts one vote, but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate, the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the district?
II.I do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula, albeit an ""adjusted"" one, would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants' proposed apportionment plan. For, as the Table appended to my Brother CLARK'S opinion so conclusively shows, whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district, no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the Tennessee Constitution could provide proportionately equal ""total representation"" for each of Tennessee's 95 counties.

The pattern suggested by the appellants in Exhibits ""A"" and ""B"" attached to their complaint is said to be a ""fair distribution"" which accords with the Tennessee Constitution, and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population. But even when tested by the ""adjusted"" formula, the plan reveals gross ""total representation"" disparities that would make it appear to be a ""crazy quilt."" For example, Loudon County, with twice the voting population of Humphreys County would have less representation than Humphreys, and about one-third the representation of Warren County, which has only 73 more voters. Among the more populous counties, similar discrepancies would appear. Although Anderson County has only somewhat over 10% more voters than Blount County, it would have *345 approximately 75% more representation. And Blount would have approximately two-thirds the representation of Montgomery County, which has about 13% less voters.[4]
III.The fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used, but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies, along with circumstances of geography and demography, could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties. The principles set out in the Tennessee Constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant. Others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for Tennessee's apportionment. And for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of ""rationality"" is not what the State Legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered.

For example, in the list of ""horribles"" cited by my Brother CLARK (ante, p. 255), all the ""underrepresented"" counties are semiurban: all contain municipalities of over 10,000 population.[5] This is not to say, however, that the *346 presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an ""urban versus rural"" plan of apportionment. Other considerations may intervene and outweigh the Legislature's desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests. The size of a county, in terms of its total area, may be a factor.[6] Or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength.[7] Again, the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or ""floterial"" districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities.[8]

More broadly, the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in Tennessee, both those relied upon by my Brother CLARK and others, may be *347 accounted for by various economic,[9] political,[10] and geographic[11] considerations. No allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process; and the record, briefs, and arguments in this Court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial.

By disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment my Brother CLARK has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle. *348 It is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiry.
IV.Apart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities, there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the Tennessee Legislature, in the exercise of a deliberate choice, to maintain the status quo. Rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment. In the interest of stability, a State may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts, thus forever ignoring shifts in population. Indeed, several States have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties, districts, cities, or towns. See Harvey, Reapportionments of State Legislatures Legal Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Probs. (1952), 364, 368-372.

It is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the Tennessee Legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years. But surely one need not search far to find rationality in the Legislature's continued refusal to recognize the growth of the urban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade. The existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population. And I understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not *349 rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters.

Once the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it isthe product of legislative give-and-take and of compromise among policies that often conflict the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courts.

[2]  The three-judge court was convened pursuant to the order of a single district judge, who, after he had reviewed certain decisions of this Court and found them distinguishable in features ""that may ultimately prove to be significant,"" held that the complaint was not so obviously without merit that he would be justified in refusing to convene a three-judge court. 175 F. Supp. 649, 652.

[4]  A county having less than, but at least two-thirds of, the population required to choose a Representative is allocated one Representative. See also Tenn. Const., Art. II,  6. A common and much more substantial departure from the number-of-voters or total-population standard is the guaranty of at least one seat to each county. See, e. g., Kansas Const., Art. 2,  2; N. J. Const., Art. 4,  3,  1.

While the Tennessee Constitution speaks of the number of ""qualified voters,"" the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over. This basis seems to have been employed by the General Assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset. The 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration, Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107, directed the courts of the several counties to select a Commissioner to enumerate ""all the male inhabitants of their respective counties, who are twenty-one years of age and upward, who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of January, 1871 . . . ."" Reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary of State and were used in the first apportionment. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. Yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the then-governing qualifications: (a) citizenship; (b) residence in the State 12 months, and in the county 6 months; (c) payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption. Acts of 1870 (2d Sess.), c. 10. (These qualifications continued at least until after 1901. See Shan. Tenn. Code Ann.,  1167, 1220 (1896; Supp. 1904).) Still, when the General Assembly directed the Secretary of State to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties, the Resolution spoke broadly of ""the impossibility of . . . [redistricting] without the census returns of the voting population from each county . . . ."" Tenn. S. J., 1871, 46-47, 96. The figures also showed a correlation with Federal Census figures for 1870. The Census reported 259,016 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. Ninth Census of the United States, 1870, Statistics of the Population 635 (1872). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report, with 15 counties not reported, gave a figure of 237,431. Using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties, the Secretary arrived at a total of 250,025. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. This and subsequent history indicate continued reference to Census figures and finally in 1901, abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of Census figures. See notes 7, 8, 9, infra. See also Williams, Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 20 Tenn. L. Rev. 235, 236, n. 6. It would therefore appear that unless there is a contrary showing at the trial, appellant's current figures, taken from the United States Census Reports, are apposite.

[14]  The appellants claim that no General Assembly constituted according to the 1901 Act will submit reapportionment proposals either to the people or to a Constitutional Convention. There is no provision for popular initiative in Tennessee. Amendments proposed in the Senate or House must first be approved by a majority of all members of each House and again by two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly next chosen. The proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to be chosen. Alternatively, the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals. Such as are adopted at a convention do not, however, become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention. Conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years. Tenn. Const., Art. XI,  3. Acts of 1951, c. 130,  3, and Acts of 1957, c. 340,  3, provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the State House of Representatives. The General Assembly's call for a 1953 Constitutional Convention originally contained a provision ""relating to the appointment [sic] of representatives and senators"" but this was excised. Tenn. H. J., 1951, 784. A Resolution introduced at the 1959 Constitutional Convention and reported unfavorably by the Rules Committee of the Convention was as follows:

""By Mr. Chambliss (of Hamilton County), Resolution No. 12 Relative to Convention considering reapportionment, which is as follows:

""WHEREAS, there is a rumor that this Limited Convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a Convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment; and

""WHEREAS, there is pending in the United States Courts in Tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking, through decree, to compel reapportionment; and

""WHEREAS, it is said that this Limited Convention, which was called for limited consideration, is yet a Constitutional Convention within the language of the Constitution as to Constitutional Conventions, forbidding frequent Conventions in the last sentence of Article Eleven, Section 3, second paragraph, more often than each six years, to-wit:

""`No such Convention shall be held oftener than once in six years.'

""NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this Convention that since this is a Limited Convention as hereinbefore set forth another Convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this Limited Convention.

""BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of this Convention that a Convention should be called by the General Assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of Court enforcement being forced on the Sovereign State of Tennessee by the Courts of the National Government may be avoided.

""BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this Convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this Convention, and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next General Assembly of Tennessee to broaden the powers of this Convention and to authorize and empower this Convention to consider a proper amendment to the Constitution that will provide, when submitted to the electorate, a method of reapportionment."" Tenn. Constitutional Convention of 1959, The Journal and Debates, 35, 278.

[15]  It is clear that appellants' federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment. There are allegations invoking the Due Process Clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the Due Process Clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes. Insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes under the Due Process Clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits. And if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment, we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Whether, when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment, taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything, or whether they could add anything however presented, is for the District Court in the first instance to decide.

The complaint, in addition to the claims under the Federal Constitution, also alleges rights, and the General Assembly's duties, under the Tennessee Constitution. Since we hold that appellants haveif it develops at trial that the facts support the allegationsa cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, we do not consider, let alone enforce, rights under a State Constitution which go further than the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, we need not assess the legal significance, in reaching our conclusion, of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 Act is ""contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .""

[16]  We need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the District Court has not yet decided it.

[17]  The accuracy of calling even such dismissals ""jurisdictional"" was questioned in Bell v. Hood. See 327 U. S., at 683.

[18]  42 U. S. C.  1983 provides: ""Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.""

[19]  This Court has frequently sustained District Court jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117; cf. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167; Egan v. Aurora, 365 U. S. 514.

[20]  Since that case was not brought to the Court until after the election had been held, the Court cited not only Wood v. Broom, but also directed dismissal for mootness, citing Brownlow v. Schwartz, 261 U. S. 216.

[21]  Compare Boeing Aircraft Co. v. King County, 330 U. S. 803 (""the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction""). See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 440.

[22]  Matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, 179 F. Supp. 470. However, the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Cf. text following, on MacDougall v. Green. And see text, infra, p. 236.

[23]  The Mayor of Nashville suing ""on behalf of himself and all residents of the City of Nashville, Davidson County, . . ."" and the Cities of Chattanooga (Hamilton County) and Knoxville (Knox County), each suing on behalf of its residents, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. Since they press the same claims as do the initial plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervenors would have standing to maintain this action in their asserted representative capacities.

[24]  The complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue ""on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee."" (Emphasis added.) This may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.

[25]  The duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows:

""Defendant, Joe C. Carr, is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks, envelopes and information slips to the County Election Commissioners, certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof; and he is further ex officio charged, together with the Governor and the Attorney General, with the duty of examining the election returns received from the County Election Commissioners and declaring the election results, by the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.

""Defendant, George F. McCanless, is the duly appointed and acting Attorney General of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the State upon the law, and is made by Section 23-1107 of the Tennessee Code Annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the State of Tennessee is attacked, and he is ex-officio charged, together with the Governor and the Secretary of State, with the duty of declaring the election results, under Section 2-140 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.

""Defendant, Jerry McDonald, is the duly appointed Coordinator of Elections in the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville, Tennessee, and as such official, is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 General Assembly of Tennessee creating said office.

""Defendant, Dr. Sam Coward, James Alexander, and Hubert Brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting the State Board of Elections, and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the Election Commissioners for all the counties of the State of Tennessee, the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the Statutes of Tennessee, Chapter 9 of Title 2 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 2-901, et seq.

""That this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities, and that said Election Commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the County Election Commissioners in the State of Tennessee, such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court; that there is a common question of law involved, namely, the constitutionality of Tennessee laws set forth in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 3-101 through Section 3-109, inclusive; that common relief is sought against all members of said Election Commissions in their official capacities, it being the duties of the aforesaid County Election Commissioners, within their respective jurisdictions, to appoint the judges of elections, to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said County, certify the results of elections held in said County to the defendants State Board of Elections and Secretary of State, and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said Counties by virtue of Sections 2-1201, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Section 2-301, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.""

The question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand.

[26]  Smiley v. Holm, supra, at 361 ("" `citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the State""); Koenig v. Flynn, supra, at 379 ("" `citizens and voters' of the State"") Wood v. Broom, supra, at 4 (""citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as representative in Congress""); cf. Carroll v. Becker, supra (candidate for office).

[27]  Mr. Justice Rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in Smiley v. Holm, supra; MR. JUSTICE BLACK stated ""that appellants had standing to sue, since the facts alleged show that they have been injured as individuals."" He relied on Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 438, 467. See 328 U. S. 564, 568.

Commentators have suggested that the following statement in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing: ""This is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens. The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity."" 328 U. S., at 552. See Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1298 (1961); Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1081-1083 (1958). But since the opinion goes on to consider the merits, it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing. Nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing. See especially Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 272-273.

[43]  This case, so frequently cited for the broad proposition that the status of an Indian tribe is a matter for the political departments, is in fact a noteworthy example of the limited and precise impact of a political question. The Cherokees brought an original suit in this Court to enjoin Georgia's assertion of jurisdiction over Cherokee territory and abolition of Cherokee government and laws. Unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment. See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 729-779. But in spite of some broader language in separate opinions, all that the Court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit: for the Cherokees could in no view be considered either a State of this Union or a ""foreign state."" Chief Justice Marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the Constitution. The Chief Justice did say that ""The acts of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation as a state, and the courts are bound by those acts,"" but here he referred to their existence ""as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others . . . ."" From there he went to ""A question of much more difficulty . . . . Do the Cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution?"" Id., at 16. Thus, while the Court referred to ""the political"" for the decision whether the tribe was an entity, a separate polity, it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue: criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the Constitution and in the common understanding of the times. As to this issue, the Court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's dictum that ""It savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department,"" id., at 20, was not addressed to the issue of the Cherokees' status to sue, but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought. Compare Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 77. The Chief Justice made clear that if the issue of the Cherokees' rights arose in a customary legal context, ""a proper case with proper parties,"" it would be justiciable. Thus, when the same dispute produced a case properly brought, in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law, and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law, the Court did void the conviction. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515. There, the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result, and despite the consequences in a heated federal-state controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the National Government, the judicial power acted to reverse the State Supreme Court. An example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, see infra.

[44]  7 How., at 29. And see 11 The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster 217 (1903).

[45]  See Mowry, The Dorr War (1901), and its exhaustive bibliography. And for an account of circumstances surrounding the decicion here, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 185-195.

Dorr himself, head of one of the two groups and held in a Rhode Island jail under a conviction for treason, had earlier sought a decision from the Supreme Court that his was the lawful government. His application for original habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was denied because the federal courts then lacked authority to issue habeas for a prisoner held under a state court sentence. Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103.

[46]  7 How., at 39.

[47]  Id., at 39, 40.

[48]  Even though the Court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this Guaranty, thus making its enforcement a political question, the Court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute: ""Unquestionably a military government, established as the permanent government of the State, would not be a republican government, and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it."" 7 How., at 45. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that if Congress did not act, the Court would. For while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of ""republican form,"" and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away, there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch, which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented.

That was not the only occasion on which this Court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the Guaranty's extreme limits: ""The guaranty is of a republican form of government. No particular government is designated as republican, neither is the exact form to be guaranteed, in any manner especially designated. Here, as in other parts of the instrument, we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended.

""The guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the States themselves to provide such a government. All the States had governments when the Constitution was adopted. In all the people participated to some extent, through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided. These governments the Constitution did not change. They were accepted precisely as they were, and it is, therefore, to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the States to provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form, within the meaning of that term as employed in the Constitution."" Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175-176. There, the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women.

In re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449, upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted. The Court there said:

""By the Constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every State in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves; but, while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and State, have been limited by written constitutions, and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities."" 139 U. S., at 461. But the Court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated.

[49]  But cf. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221; National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350.

[50]  6 Wall., at 65, 66.

[51]  The First Reconstruction Act opened: ""Whereas no legal State governments . . . now exists [sic] in the rebel States of . . . Georgia [and] Mississippi . . . ; and whereas it is necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and republican State governments can be legally established: . . ."" 14 Stat. 428. And see 15 Stat. 2, 14.

[52]  In Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, the State sought to enjoin the President from executing the Acts, alleging that his role was purely ministerial. The Court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial, and that although the State sought to compel inaction rather than action, the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which ""general principles . . . forbid judicial interference with the exercise of Executive discretion."" 4 Wall., at 499. See also Mississippi v. Stanton, 154 U. S. 554; and see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 463.

For another instance of congressional action challenged as transgressing the Guaranty Clause, see The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125-126, overruled, Graves v. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466.

[53]  On the other hand, the implication of the Guaranty Clause in a case concerning congressional action does not always preclude judicial action. It has been held that the clause gives Congress no power to impose restrictions upon a State's admission which would undercut the constitutional mandate that the State be on an equal footing. Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. And in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, although Congress had determined that the State's government was not republican in form, the State's standing to bring an original action in this Court was sustained.

[54]  See, infra, p. 235, considering Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920.

[55]  Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, 183 (Field, J., dissenting).

[56]  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 270 F. 2d 594, relying upon, inter alia, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161.

[57]  The Court's opinion was joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, noting his adherence to the dissents in Colegrove and South v. Peters, supra; and the judgment was concurred in by MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, who wrote that the decision should rest on the Equal Protection Clause rather than on the Fifteenth Amendment, since there had been not solely a denial of the vote (if there had been that at all) but also a ""fencing out"" of a racial group.

[58]  No holding to the contrary is to be found in Cave v. Newell, 246 U. S. 650, dismissing a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, 272 Mo. 653, 199 S. W. 1014; or in Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1.

[59]  The ground of Mr. Justice Rutledge's vote to affirm is further explained in his footnote 3, 328 U. S., at 566: "" `The power of a court of equity to act is a discretionary one. . . . Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state laws, it should do so only ""to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and imminent."" ' American Federation of Labor v. Watson, 327 U. S. 582, 593 and cases cited.""

No constitutional questions, including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population, were decided in Colegrove. Six of the participating Justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits. Mr. Justice Rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them. He said: ""There is [an alternative to constitutional decision] in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great, together with the possibilities for collision [with the political departments of the Government], that the admonition [against avoidable constitutional decision] is appropriate to be followed here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra, would otherwise be brought into question."" 328 U. S., at 564-565. He also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, decided no constitutional questions but ""the Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill."" 328 U. S., at 565; see also, id., at 573. We agree with this view of Wood v. Broom.

[60]  See also Buford v. State Board of Elections, 206 Tenn. 480, 334 S. W. 2d 726; State ex rel. Sanborn v. Davidson County Board of Election Comm'rs, No. 36,391 Tenn. Sup. Ct., Oct. 29, 1954 (unreported); 8 Vand. L. Rev. 501 (1955).
DOUGLAS CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  I feel strongly that many of the cases cited by the Court and involving so-called ""political"" questions were wrongly decided.

In joining the opinion, I do not approve those decisions but only construe the Court's opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held.

[2]  The statements in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42, that this guaranty is enforceable only by Congress or the Chief Executive is not maintainable. Of course the Chief Executive, not the Court, determines how a State will be protected against invasion. Of course each House of Congress, not the Court, is ""the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members."" Article I, Section 5, Clause 1. But the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights (7 How., at 41), however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in Rhode Island at the time of Dorr's Rebellion, states no general principle. It indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinionthe modern decisions of the Court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights. Today we would not say with Chief Justice Taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those ""to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State."" Ibid.

Moreover, the Court's refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon Rhode Island (id., at 45-46) is indefensible, as Mr. Justice Woodbury maintained in his dissent. Id., at 59 et seq. Today we would ask with him: "". . . who could hold for a moment, when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself, either in the general government or most of the States, without an express constitutional permission, that all other writs and laws could be suspended, and martial law substituted for them over the whole State or country, without any express constitutional license to that effect, in any emergency?"" Id., at 67.

Justice Woodbury went on to say:

""It would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power, exercised either by legislatures, or the executive, or courts, when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks, and of fixed and known laws, and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power. And it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency, and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon, than to allow, beforehand, the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned, and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet.

""No tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws, like some of the tyrannical Stuarts, or to repeal, or abolish, or suspend the whole body of them; or, in other words, appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men.

""Whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises, they cannot be upheld by the laws, as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them, however the Assembly of Rhode Island, under the exigency, may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional. It is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by Parliament to pass bills of attainder, belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law."" Id., at 69-70.

What he wrote was later to become the tradition, as expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U. S. 378, 401: ""What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.""

[3]  The category of the ""political"" question is, in my view, narrower than the decided cases indicate. ""Even the English courts have held that a resolution of one House of Parliament does not change the law (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 A. & E. 1; and Bowles v. Bank of England (No. 2) [1913] 1 Ch. 57), and these decisions imply that the House of Commons acting alone does not constitute the `Parliament' recognized by the English courts."" 103 Sol. Jour. 995, 996. The Court in Bowles v. Bank of England, [1913] 1 Ch. 57, 84-85, stated: ""By the statute 1 W. & M., usually known as the Bill of Rights, it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights still remains unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions. It follows that, with regard to the powers of the Crown to levy taxation, no resolution, either of the Committee for Ways and Means or of the House itself, has any legal effect whatever. Such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.""

In The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655, the Court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the Constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law. Cf. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433.

Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, involved the application of the Reconstruction Acts to Georgialaws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that State. Yet the Court refused to take jurisdiction. That question was no more ""political"" than a host of others we have entertained. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579; Alabama v. Texas, 347 U. S. 272.

Today would this Court hold nonjusticiable or ""political"" a suit to enjoin a Governor who, like Fidel Castro, takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws?

Georgia v. Stanton, supra, expresses a philosophy at war with Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, and Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304. The dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning. See Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337; Sterling v. Constantin, supra, note 2.

[4]  We are told by the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in an amicus brief:

""Regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the United States has become a predominantly urban country where well over two-thirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs, political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times. Apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections.

""As a consequence, the municipality of 1960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population. These demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas.

""The National Institute of Municipal Law Officers has for many years recognized the wide-spread complaint that by far the greatest preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which, in the main, fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators.

""Since World War II, the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education, transportation, and housing. Adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent, due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities. This situation is directly attributable to considerable under-representation of cities in the legislatures of most states."" Amicus brief, pp. 2-3.

[5]  The recent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court that a legislature, though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme, is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act (Cedar Rapids v. Cox, 252 Iowa 948, 964, 108 N. W. 2d 253, 262-263; cf. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40) is plainly correct.

There need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra.

The District Court need not undertake a complete reapportionment. It might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices. Or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action. That was the result in Asbury Park Press v. Woolley, 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705, where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction:

""If by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise, and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action, the doors of the courts must be open to him. The law-making body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence."" 33 N. J., at 14, 161 A. 2d, at 711. The court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act. For the sequel see Application of Lamb, 67 N. J. Super. 39, 46-47, 169 A. 2d 822, 825-826.

Reapportionment was also the result in Magraw v. Donovan, 159 F. Supp. 901, where a federal three-judge District Court took jurisdiction, saying, 163 F. Supp. 184, 187:

""Here it is the unmistakable duty of the State Legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes. . . . Early in January 1959 the 61st Session of the Minnesota Legislature will convene, all of the members of which will be newly elected on November 4th of this year. The facts which have been presented to us will be available to them. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the State Constitution. We defer decision on all the issues presented (including that of the power of this Court to grant relief), in order to afford the Legislature full opportunity to `heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict.' ""

See 177 F. Supp. 803, where the case was dismissed as moot, the State Legislature having acted.
CLARK CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  The opinion stated at 551 that the Court ""could also dispose of this case on the authority of Wood v. Broom [287 U. S. 1 (1932)]."" Wood v. Broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment Act.

[2]  Similarly, the Equal Protection Clause was not invoked in Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940 (1950).

[3]  I do not read the later case of Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804 (1947), as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here. That was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions, two congressional Acts, and three state constitutional provisions.

[4]  Georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population, giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties, four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population, and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties.

[5]  See Part I of the Appendix to MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissent, post, p. 341.

[6]  It is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago. But many Assembly Sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act, and in any event ""[a] statute [constitutionally] valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied."" Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Walters, 294 U. S. 405, 415 (1935).

[7]  ""Total representation"" indicates the combined representation in the State Senate (33 members) and the State House of Representatives (99 members) in the Assembly of Tennessee. Assuming a county has one representative, it is credited in this calculation with 1/99. Likewise, if the same county has one-third of a senate seat, it is credited with another 1/99, and thus such a county, in our calculation, would have a ""total representation"" of two; if a county has one representative and one-sixth of a senate seat, it is credited with 1.5/99, or 1.50. It is this last figure that I use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear. The 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the State to act. However, the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one.

[8]  Of course this was not the case in the Georgia county unit system, South v. Peters, supra, or the Illinois initiative plan, MacDougall v. Green, supra, where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight.

[9]  It is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this Court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim. See, e. g., Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, 104 N. W. 2d 63 (1960).

[*]  It is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing North and South. Indeed, in the present House of Representatives, for example, Michigan's congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants, according to the 1960 census, than are Louisiana's. Michigan's Sixteenth District, which is 93.1% urban, contains 802,994 persons and its Twelfth, which is 47.6% urban, contains 177,431one-fifth as many persons. Louisiana's most populous district, the Sixth, is 53.6% urban and contains 536,029 persons, and its least populous, the Eighth, 36.7% urban, contains 263,850nearly half. Gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a State should have equal weight is as true, e. g., of California, Illinois, and Ohio as it is of Georgia. See United States Department of Commerce, Census Release, February 24, 1962, CB62-23.
FRANKFURTER DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  See Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1; Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, rehearing denied, 329 U. S. 825, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, 329 U.

Neely, 50 F. 2d 685 (C. A. 7th Cir.).

[2]  Although the motion to intervene by the Mayor of Nashville asserted an interest in the litigation in only a representative capacity, the complaint which he subsequently filed set forth that he was a qualified voter who also sued in his own behalf. The municipalities of Knoxville and Chattanooga purport to represent their residents. Since the claims of the municipal intervenors do not differ materially from those of the parties who sue as individual voters, the Court need not now determine whether the municipalities are proper parties to this proceeding. See, e. g., Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.

[3]  The original complaint named as defendants Tennessee's Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and the three members of the State Board of Elections, seeking to make the Board members representatives of all the State's County Election Commissioners. The prayer in an intervening complaint by the City of Knoxville, that the Commissioners of Elections of Knox County be added as parties defendant seems not to have been acted on by the court below. Defendants moved to dismiss, inter alia, on the ground of failure to join indispensable parties, and they argue in this Court that only the County Election Commissioners of the ninety-five counties are the effective administrators of Tennessee's elections laws, and that none of the defendants have substantial duties in connection therewith. The District Court deferred ruling on this ground of the motion. Inasmuch as it involves questions of local law more appropriately decided by judges sitting in Tennessee than by this Court, and since in any event the failure to join County Election Commissioners in this action looking to prospective relief could be corrected, if necessary, by amendment of the complaints, the issue does not concern the Court on this appeal.

[4]  Jurisdiction is predicated upon R. S.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983, and 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3).

[5]  However, counties having two-thirds of the ratio required for a Representative are entitled to seat one member in the House, and there are certain geographical restrictions upon the formation of Senate districts. The applicable provisions of Article II of the Tennessee Constitution are:

""Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.""

""Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.""

""Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.""

[6]  It is alleged that certain amendments to the Act of 1901 made only minor modifications of that Act, adjusting the boundaries of individual districts in a manner not material to plaintiffs' claims.

[7]  The exhibits do not reveal the source of the population figures which they set forth, but it appears that the figures were taken from the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 41, at 76-91. These census figures represent the total population over twenty-one years of age in each Tennessee county; they do not purport to enumerate ""qualified voters"" or ""qualified electors,"" the measure of apportionment prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution. See note 5, supra. To qualify to vote in Tennessee, in addition to fulfilling the age requirement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State for twelve months and of the county where he offers his vote for six months next preceding the election, and must not be under the disqualification attaching to conviction for certain offenses. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  2-201, 2-205. The statistics found in the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 42, at 92-97, suggest that the residence requirement, in particular, may be an unknown variable of considerable significance. Appellants do not suggest a means by which a court, on the basis of the federal census figures, can determine the number of qualified voters in the various Tennessee counties.

[8]  The ""county aid funds"" derived from a portion of a state gasoline privilege tax, for example, are distributed among the counties as follows: one-half equally among the ninety-five counties, one-quarter on the basis of area, one-quarter on the basis of population, to be used by county authorities in the building, repairing and improving of county roads and bridges. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  54-403. Appellants urge that this distribution is discriminatory.

[9]  Plaintiffs also suggested, as an alternative to at-large elections, that the District Court might itself redistrict the State. They did not, however, expressly pray such relief.

[10]  See Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 45 et seq. (1961).

[11]  See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634, 635; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat. 52; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415; Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38; Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635; Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202; Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270; Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297; Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578; Clark v. Allen, 331 U. S. 503. Compare Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, with United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691. Of course, judgment concerning the ""political"" nature of even a controversy affecting the Nation's foreign affairs is not a simple mechanical matter, and certain of the Court's decisions have accorded scant weight to the consideration of unity of action in the conduct of external relations. Compare Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, 335 U. S. 377, with United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203.

[12]  Obviously, this is the equivalent of saying that the characteristics are not ""constitutionally requisite"" in a judicially enforceable sense. The recognition of their necessity as a condition of legislation is left, as is observance of certain other constitutional commands, to the conscience of the non-judicial organs. Cf. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66.

[13]  Also compare the Coleman case and United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, with Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221. See the National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350; and consider the Court's treatment of the several contentions in Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130.

[14]  E. g., Myers v. Anderson, 238 U. S. 368; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649. The action for damages for improperly rejecting an elector's vote had been given by the English law since the time of Ashby v. White, 1 Brown's Cases in Parliament 62; 2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320, a case which in its own day precipitated an intra-parliamentary war of major dimensions. See 6 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1810), 225-324, 376-436. Prior to the racial-discrimination cases, this Court had recognized the action, by implication, in dictum in Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, and Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U. S. 58, both respecting federal elections.

[15]  Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.

[16]  By statute an action for preventive relief is now given the United States in certain voting cases. 71 Stat. 637, 42 U. S. C.  1971 (c), amending R. S.  2004. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17; United States v. Thomas, 362 U. S. 58.

[17]  Compare Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, and cases following, with Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50.

[18]  Compare Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, with Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 20, 28 (Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring), 51 and 75 (Mr. Justice Thompson, dissenting).

[19]  This was an alternative ground of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court. Id., at 20. The question which Marshall reserved as ""unnecessary to decide,"" ibid., was not the justiciability of the bill in this aspect, but the ""more doubtful"" question whether that ""part of the bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession,"" might be entertained. Ibid. Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring, found the controversy non-justiciable and would have put the ruling solely on this ground, id., at 28, and Mr. Justice Thompson, in dissent, agreed that much of the matter in the bill was not fit for judicial determination. Id., at 51, 75.

[20]  Cf. Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475.

[21]  Considerations similar to those which determined the Cherokee Nation case and Georgia v. Stanton no doubt explain the celebrated decision in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Co., 1 Ves. jun. *371; 2 Ves. jun. *56, rather than any attribution of a portion of British sovereignty, in respect of Indian affairs, to the company. The reluctance of the English Judges to involve themselves in contests of factional political power is of ancient standing. In The Duke of York's Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Parl. 375, printed in Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915), 1, the role which the Judges were asked to play appears to have been rather that of advocates than of judges, but the answer which they returned to the Lords relied on reasons equally applicable to either role.

[22]  ""The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.""

[23]  Cf. the cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such restriction upon the form of a State's governmental organization as will permit persons affected by government action to complain that in its organization principles of separation of powers have been violated. E. g., Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71; Soliah v. Heskin, 222 U. S. 522; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U. S. 254. The same consistent refusal of this Court to find that the Federal Constitution restricts state power to design the structure of state political institutions is reflected in the cases rejecting claims arising out of the States' creation, alteration, or destruction of local subdivisions or their powers, insofar as these claims are made by the subdivisions themselves, see Laramie County v. Albany County, 92 U. S. 307; Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250 U. S. 394; Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 270 U. S. 378, 389-390; Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, or by the whole body of their residents who share only a general, undifferentiated interest in their preservation. See Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161. The policy is also given effect by the denial of ""standing"" to persons seeking to challenge state action as infringing the interest of some separate unit within the State's administrative structurea denial which precludes the arbitrament by federal courts of what are only disputes over the local allocation of government functions and powers. See, e. g., Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U. S. 192; Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250; Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.

[24]  223 U. S., at 141. "". . . [T]he contention, if held to be sound, would necessarily affect the validity, not only of the particular statute which is before us, but of every other statute passed in Oregon since the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And indeed the propositions go further than this, since in their essence they assert that there is no governmental function, legislative or judicial, in Oregon, because it cannot be assumed, if the proposition be well founded, that there is at one and the same time one and the same government which is republican in form and not of that character."" Compare Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 38-39:

"". . . For, if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff, and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentioned,if it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing government,then the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities; its taxes wrongfully collected; its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid; its public accounts improperly settled; and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void, and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.

""When the decision of this court might lead to such results, it becomes its duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction.""

[25]  See Bowen, The Recent Contest in Rhode Island (1844); Frieze, A Concise History of the Efforts to Obtain an Extension of Suffrage in Rhode Island; From the Year 1811 to 1842 (2d ed. 1842); Mowry, The Dorr War (1901); Wayland, The Affairs of Rhode Island (2d ed. 1842).

[26]  The Court reasoned, with respect to the guarantee against domestic violence also contained in Art. IV,  4, that this, too, was an authority committed solely to Congress; that Congress had empowered the President, not the courts, to enforce it; and that it was inconceivable that the courts should assume a power to make determinations in the premises which might conflict with those of the Executive. It noted further that, in fact, the President had recognized the governor of the charter government as the lawful authority in Rhode Island, although it had been unnecessary to call out the militia in his support.

[27]  See note 24, supra.

[28]  Id., at 39, 46-47.

[29]  Id., at 41-42.

[30]  In evaluating the Court's determination not to inquire into the authority of the charter government, it must be remembered that, throughout the country, Dorr ""had received the sympathy of the Democratic press. His cause, therefore, became distinctly a party issue."" 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed. 1937), 186.

[31]  Appellants also allege discrimination in the legislature's allocation of certain tax burdens and benefits. Whether or not such discrimination would violate the Equal Protection Clause if the tax statutes were challenged in a proper proceeding, see Dane v. Jackson, 256 U. S. 589; cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 268, these recitative allegations do not affect the nature of the controversy which appellants' complaints present.

[32]  Appellants would find a ""right"" to have one's ballot counted on authority of United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383; United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385. All that these cases hold is that conspiracies to commit certain sharp election practices which, in a federal election, cause ballots not to receive the weight which the law has in fact given them, may amount to deprivations of the constitutionally secured right to vote for federal officers. But see United States v. Bathgate, 246 U. S. 220. The cases do not so much as suggest that there exists a constitutional limitation upon the relative weight to which the law might properly entitle respective ballots, even in federal elections.

[84]  Various indices of population were employed among the States which took account of the factor of numbers. Some counted all inhabitants, e. g., N. J. Const., 1844, Art. IV,  3; some, only white inhabitants, e. g., Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8; some, male inhabitants over twenty-one, e. g., Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4-5; some, qualified voters, e. g., Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6; some excluded aliens, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1846, Art. III,  4, 5 (and untaxed persons of color); some excluded untaxed Indians and military personnel, e. g., Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. For present purposes these differences, although not unimportant as revealing fundamental divergences in representation theory, will be disregarded.

[85]  Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  5, 6, 7; Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8, 9; Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4, 5, 6; Minn. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  2; Wis. Const., 1848, Art. IV,  3 to 5; Mass. Const., 1780, Amends. XXI, XXII; Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. All of these but Minnesota made provision for periodic reapportionment. Nevada's Constitution of 1864, Art. XV,  13, provided that the federal censuses and interim state decennial enumerations should serve as the bases of representation for both houses, but did not expressly require either numerical equality or reapportionment at fixed intervals.

Several of these constitutions contain provisions which forbid splitting counties or which otherwise require recognition of local boundaries. See, e. g., the severe restriction in Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  9. Such provisions will almost inevitably produce numerical inequalities. See, for example, University of Oklahoma, Bureau of Government Research, Legislative Apportionment in Oklahoma (1956), 21-23. However, because their effect in this regard will turn on idiosyncratic local factors, and because other constitutional provisions are a more significant source of inequality, these provisions are here disregarded.

[86]  Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6 (two-thirds of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); W. Va. Const., 1861-1863, Art. IV,  4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (one-half of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); Mich. Const., 1850, Art. IV,  2 to 4 (one-half of a ratio entitles each county thereafter organized to one representative in the House). In Oregon and Iowa a major-fraction rule applied which gave a House seat not only to counties having a moiety of a single ratio, but to all counties having more than half a ratio in excess of the multiple of a ratio. Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  6, note 85, supra; Iowa Const., 1857, Art. III,  33, 34, 35, 37, note 89, infra.

[88]  It also appears, although the section is not altogether clear, that the provisions of West Virginia's Constitution controlling apportionment of senators would operate in favor of the State's less populous regions by limiting any single county to a maximum of two senators.

The Virginia Constitutions and Texas' provisions for apportioning its lower chamber do not in terms require equality of numbers, although they call for reapportionment following a census. In Arkansas, the legislature was authorized, but not commanded, to reapportion periodically; it is not clear that equality was required.

Const., 1911, Art. IV, following  41. The Colorado and Utah Constitutions provide for reapportionment ""according to ratios to be fixed by law"" after periodic census and enumeration. In New Mexico the legislature is authorized, but not commanded, to reapportion periodically. North Dakota does not in terms demand equality in House representation; members are to be assigned among the several senatorial districts, which are of equal population.

On the basis of 1910 census figures, this apportionment yielded, for example, a senatorial-ratio differential of more than four to one between Mohave and Cochise or between Mohave and Maricopa Counties.

Becker, 290 Mo. 560, 235 S. W. 1017, and especially the dissenting opinion of Higbee, J., 290 Mo., at 613, 235 S. W., at 1037.

[149]  See text at notes 139-143, supra.

[150]  Decisions of state courts which have entertained apportionment cases under their respective state constitutions do not, of course, involve the very different considerations relevant to federal judicial intervention. State-court adjudication does not involve the delicate problems of federal-state relations which would inhere in the exercise of federal judicial power to impose restrictions upon the States' shaping of their own governmental institutions. Moreover, state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment to apportionment matters. Some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review, see, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1938, Art. III,  5, and even where they do not, they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate. See, e. g., Asbury Park Press. Inc., v. Woolley. 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705.

[151]  Appellants' suggestion that, although no relief may need be given, jurisdiction ought to be retained as a ""spur"" to legislative action does not merit discussion.

[152]  See note 24, supra.
HARLAN APPENDIX FOOTNOTES[1]  The relevant provisions of the Tennessee Constitution are Art. II,  5 and 6:

""Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.

""Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no counties shall be divided in forming a district.""

[2]  This formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion, but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented. Knox County, for example, is said to have a ""total representation"" of 7.25. It elects (1) three direct representatives (value 3.00); (2) one representative from a two-county district (value .50); (3) one direct senator (value 3.00); and (4) one senator in a four-county district (value .75). See Appendix to opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, ante, pp. 262-264.

[3]  If this ""adjusted"" formula for measuring ""total representation"" is applied to the other ""horribles"" cited in the concurring opinion (ante, p. 255), it reveals that these countieswhich purportedly have equal ""total representation"" but distinctly unequal voting population do not have the same ""total representation"" at all. Rather than having the same representation as Rutherford County, Moore County has only about 40% of what Rutherford has. Decatur County has only 55% of the representation of Carter County. While Loudon and Anderson Counties are substantially underrepresented, this is because of their proximity to Knox County, which outweighs their votes in the Sixth Senatorial District and in the Eighth Floterial District.

[4]  These disparities are as serious, if not more so, when my Brother CLARK'S formula is applied to the appellants' proposal. For example, if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants' distribution, Moore County, with a voting population of 2,340, is given more electoral strength than Decatur County, with a voting population of 5,563. Carter County (voting population 23,302) has 20% more ""total representation"" than Anderson County (voting population 33,990), and 33% more than Rutherford County (voting population 25,316).

[5]  Murfreesboro, Rutherford County (pop. 16,017); Elizabethton, Carter County (pop. 10,754); Oak Ridge, Anderson County (pop. 27,387). Tennessee Blue Book, 1960, pp. 143-149.

[6]  For example, Carter and Washington Counties are each approximately 60% as large as Maury and Madison Counties in terms of square miles, and this may explain the disparity between their ""total representation"" figures.

[7]  For example, in addition to being ""semi-urban,"" Blount County is the location of the City of Alcoa, where the Aluminum Company of America has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant. This may explain the difference between its ""total representation"" and that of Gibson County, which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as Maryville.

[8]  For example, Chester County (voting population 6,391) is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented. But under the appellants' proposal, Chester would be combined with populous Madison County in a ""floterial district"" and with four others, including Shelby County, in a senatorial district. Consequently, its total representation according to the Appendix to my Brother CLARK'S opinion would be .19. (Ante, p. 262.) This would have the effect of disenfranchising all the county's voters. Similarly, Rhea County's almost 9,000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent.

[9]  For example, it is primarily the eastern portion of the State that is complaining of malapportionment (along with the Cities of Memphis and Nashville). But the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density, even outside the large urban areas, is highest. Consequently, if Tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests, as constitutionally it was entitled to do, it would necessarily reduce representation from the east.

[10]  For example, sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers; in Tennessee, the House is set at 99 and the Senate at 33. It might have been deemed desirable, therefore, to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation. The proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner.

[11]  For example, Moore County is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed two-thirds of the average voting population per county (which is the standard prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution for the assignment of a direct representative), thus qualifying for direct representatives. Consequently Moore County must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district, and the Tennessee Constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties.

Yo, if I'm stressing you that blessing that's sent from heaven
These days start to feel like hours and hours feel more like seconds

I don't see nothing different, our pigments they coincide
We hold each other so tight they couldn't break us if they tried
My eyes are are those of the blind, I see no color or size
I feel the love in your touch and I trust what's inside your mind, okay
I know that we've been through a lot
I know that we both grew up
You know I missed you a lot
When I was young I was dumb
Didn't think you'd fit in my plot
And I appreciate the break because I love what we got now
You give me chills and I can't imagine you leaving

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone"
730,Old Man,Sawyer Fredericks,"So I broke my leg. Doesn’t matter how–since the accident I’ve heard plenty of broken-leg tales, and, I’m telling you, I didn’t realize that walking down the stairs, walking down hills, dancing in high heels, or stamping your foot on the brake pedal could be so dangerous. At any rate, like numerous broken-legged intellectuals before me, I found the prospect of three months in bed in the dining room rather seductive from a book-reading point of view, and I eagerly got started. Great novels piled up on my table, and right at the top was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which, I’m embarrassed to admit, I hadn’t read since junior high school. The novel took me a couple of days (it was longer than I had remembered), and I closed the cover stunned. Yes, stunned. Not, by any means, by the artistry of the book but by the notion that this is the novel all American literature grows out of, that this is a great novel, that this is even a serious novel.

Although Huck had his fans at publication, his real elevation into the pantheon was worked out early in the Propaganda Era, between 1948 and 1955, by Lionel Trilling, Leslie Fiedler, T. S. Eliot, Joseph Wood Krutch, and some lesser lights, in the introductions to American and British editions of the novel and in such journals as Partisan Review and The New York Times Book Review. The requirements of Huck’s installation rapidly revealed themselves: the failure of the last twelve chapters (in which Huck finds Jim imprisoned on the Phelps plantation and Tom Sawyer is reintroduced and elaborates a cruel and unnecessary scheme for Jim’s liberation) had to be diminished, accounted for, or forgiven; after that, the novel’s special qualities had to be placed in the context first of other American novels (to their detriment) and then of world literature. The best bets here seemed to be Twain’s style and the river setting, and the critics invested accordingly: Eliot, who had never read the novel as a boy, traded on his own childhood beside the big river, elevating Huck to the Boy, and the Mississippi to the River God, therein finding the sort of mythic resonance that he admired. Trilling liked the river god idea, too, though he didn’t bother to capitalize it. He also thought that Twain, through Huck’s lying, told truths, one of them being (I kid you not) that ""something ... had gone out of American life after the [Civil War], some simplicity, some innocence, some peace."" What Twain himself was proudest of in the novel–his style–Trilling was glad to dub ""not less than definitive in American literature. The prose of Huckleberry Finn established for written prose the virtues of American colloquial speech. . . . He is the master of the style that escapes the fixity of the printed page, that sounds in our ears with the immediacy of the heard voice, the very voice of unpretentious truth."" The last requirement was some quality that would link Huck to other, though ""lesser,"" American novels such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, that would possess some profound insight into the American character. Leslie Fiedler obligingly provided it when he read homoerotic attraction into the relationship between Huck and Jim, pointing out the similarity of this to such other white man-dark man friendships as those between Ishmael and Queequeg in Moby-Dick and Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook in James Fenimore Cooper’s Last of the Mohicans.

The canonization proceeded apace: great novel (Trilling, 1950), greatest novel (Eliot, 1950), world-class novel (Lauriat Lane Jr., 1955). Sensible naysayers, such as Leo Marx, were lost in the shuffle of propaganda. But, in fact, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has little to offer in the way of greatness. There is more to be learned about the American character from its canonization than through its canonization.

Let me hasten to point out that, like most others, I don’t hold any grudges against Huck himself. He’s just a boy trying to survive. The villain here is Mark Twain, who knew how to give Huck a voice but didn’t know how to give him a novel. Twain was clearly aware of the story’s difficulties. Not finished with having revisited his boyhood in Tom Sawyer, Twain conceived of a sequel and began composition while still working on Tom Sawyer’s page proofs. Four hundred pages into it, having just passed Cairo and exhausted most of his memories of Hannibal and the upper Mississippi, Twain put the manuscript aside for three years. He was facing a problem every novelist is familiar with: his original conception was beginning to conflict with the implications of the actual story. It is at this point in the story that Huck and Jim realize two things: they have become close friends, and they have missed the Ohio River and drifted into what for Jim must be the most frightening territory of all–down the river, the very place Miss Watson was going to sell him to begin with. Jim’s putative savior, Huck, has led him as far astray as a slave can go, and the farther they go, the worse it is going to be for him. Because the Ohio was not Twain’s territory, the fulfillment of Jim’s wish would necessarily lead the novel away from the artistic integrity that Twain certainly sensed his first four hundred pages possessed. He found himself writing not a boy’s novel, like Tom Sawyer, but a man’s novel, about real moral dilemmas and growth. The patina of nostalgia for a time and place, Missouri in the 1840s (not unlike former President Ronald Reagan’s nostalgia for his own boyhood, when ""Americans got along""), had been transformed into actual longing for a timeless place of friendship and freedom, safe and hidden, on the big river. But the raft had floated Huck and Jim, and their author with them, into the truly dark heart of the American soul and of American history: slave country.

Twain came back to the novel and worked on it twice again, once to rewrite the chapters containing the feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, and later to introduce the Duke and the Dauphin. It is with the feud that the novel begins to fail, because from here on the episodes are mere distractions from the true subject of the work: Huck’s affection for and responsibility to Jim. The signs of this failure are everywhere, as Jim is pushed to the side of the narrative, hiding on the raft and confined to it, while Huck follows the Duke and the Dauphin onshore to the scenes of much simpler and much less philosophically taxing moral dilemmas, such as fraud. Twain was by nature an improviser, and he was pleased enough with these improvisations to continue. When the Duke and the Dauphin finally betray Jim by selling him for forty dollars, Huck is shocked, but the fact is neither he nor Twain has come up with a plan that would have saved Jim in the end. Tom Sawyer does that.

Considerable critical ink has flowed over the years in an attempt to integrate the Tom Sawyer chapters with the rest of the book, but it has flowed in vain. As Leo Marx points out, and as most readers sense intuitively, once Tom reappears, ""[m]ost of those traits which made [Huck] so appealing a hero now disappear. . . . It should be added at once that Jim doesn’t mind too much. The fact is that he has undergone a similar transformation. On the raft he was an individual, man enough to denounce Huck when Huck made him the victim of a practical joke. In the closing episode, however, we lose sight of Jim in the maze of farcical invention."" And the last twelve chapters are boring, a sure sign that an author has lost the battle between plot and theme and is just filling in the blanks.

As with all bad endings, the problem really lies at the beginning, and at the beginning of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn neither Huck nor Twain takes Jim’s desire for freedom at all seriously; that is, they do not accord it the respect that a man’s passion deserves. The sign of this is that not only do the two never cross the Mississippi to Illinois, a free state, but they hardly even consider it. In both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, the Jackson’s Island scenes show that such a crossing, even in secret, is both possible and routine, and even though it would present legal difficulties for an escaped slave, these would certainly pose no more hardship than locating the mouth of the Ohio and then finding passage up it. It is true that there could have been slave catchers in pursuit (though the novel ostensibly takes place in the 1840s and the Fugitive Slave Act was not passed until 1850), but Twain’s moral failure, once Huck and Jim link up, is never even to account for their choice to go down the river rather than across it. What this reveals is that for all his lip service to real attachment between white boy and black man, Twain really saw Jim as no more than Huck’s sidekick, homoerotic or otherwise. All the claims that are routinely made for the book’s humanitarian power are, in the end, simply absurd. Jim is never autonomous, never has a vote, always finds his purposes subordinate to Huck’s, and, like every good sidekick, he never minds. He grows ever more passive and also more affectionate as Huck and the Duke and the Dauphin and Tom (and Twain) make ever more use of him for their own purposes. But this use they make of him is not supplementary; it is integral to Twain’s whole conception of the novel. Twain thinks that Huck’s affection is a good enough reward for Jim.

The sort of meretricious critical reasoning that has raised Huck’s paltry good intentions to a ""strategy of subversion"" (David L. Smith) and a ""convincing indictment of slavery"" (Eliot) precisely mirrors the same sort of meretricious reasoning that white people use to convince themselves that they are not ""racist."" If Huck feels positive toward Jim, and loves him, and thinks of him as a man, then that’s enough. He doesn’t actually have to act in accordance with his feelings. White Americans always think racism is a feeling, and they reject it or they embrace it. To most Americans, it seems more honorable and nicer to reject it, so they do, but they almost invariably fail to understand that how they feel means very little to black Americans, who understand racism as a way of structuring American culture, American politics, and the American economy. To invest The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with ""greatness"" is to underwrite a very simplistic and evasive theory of what racism is and to promulgate it, philosophically, in schools and the media as well as in academic journals. Surely the discomfort of many readers, black and white, and the censorship battles that have dogged Huck Finn in the last twenty years are understandable in this context. No matter how often the critics ""place in context"" Huck’s use of the word ""nigger,"" they can never excuse or fully hide the deeper racism of the novel–the way Twain and Huck use Jim because they really don’t care enough about his desire for freedom to let that desire change their plans. And to give credit to Huck suggests that the only racial insight Americans of the nineteenth or twentieth century are capable of is a recognition of the obvious–that blacks, slave and free, are human.

Ernest Hemingway, thinking of himself, as always, once said that all American literature grew out of Huck Finn. It undoubtedly would have been better for American literature, and American culture, if our literature had grown out of one of the best-selling novels of all time, another American work of the nineteenth century, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which for its portrayal of an array of thoughtful, autonomous, and passionate black characters leaves Huck Finn far behind. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was published in 1852, when Twain was seventeen, still living in Hannibal and contributing to his brother’s newspapers, still sympathizing with the South, nine years before his abortive career in the Confederate Army. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the most popular novel of its era, universally controversial. In 1863, when Harriet Beecher Stowe visited the White House, Abraham Lincoln condescended to remark to her, ""So this is the little lady who made this great war.""

The story, familiar to most nineteenth-century Americans, either through the novel or through the many stage adaptations that sentimentalized Stowe’s work, may be sketched briefly: A Kentucky slave, Tom, is sold to pay off a debt to a slave trader, who takes him to New Orleans. On the boat trip downriver, Tom is purchased by the wealthy Augustine St. Clare at the behest of his daughter, Eva. After Eva’s death, and then St. Clare’s, Tom is sold again, this time to Simon Legree, whose remote plantation is the site of every form of cruelty and degradation. The novel was immediately read and acclaimed by any number of excellent judges: Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, George Sand–the whole roster of nineteenth-century liberals whose work we read today and try to persuade ourselves that Huck Finn is equal to. English novelist and critic Charles Kingsley thought Uncle Tom’s Cabin the best novel ever written. These writers honored Stowe’s book for all its myriad virtues. One of these was her adept characterization of a whole world of whites and blacks who find themselves gripped by slavery, many of whose names have entered the American language as expressions–not only Uncle Tom himself but Simon Legree and, to a lesser extent, little Eva and the black child Topsy. The characters appear, one after another, vivified by their attitudes, desires, and opinions as much as by their histories and their fates. Surely Augustine St. Clare, Tom’s owner in New Orleans, is an exquisite portrayal of a humane but indecisive man, who knows what he is doing but not how to stop it. Surely Cassy, a fellow slave whom Tom meets on the Legree plantation, is one of the great angry women in all of literature–not only bitter, murderous, and nihilistic but also intelligent and enterprising. Surely the midlife spiritual journey of Ophelia St. Clare, Augustine’s Yankee cousin, from self-confident ignorance to affectionate understanding is most convincing, as is Topsy’s parallel journey from ignorance and self-hatred to humanity. The ineffectual Mr. Shelby and his submissive, and subversive, wife; the slave trader Haley; Tom’s wife, Chloe; Augustine’s wife, Marie; Legree’s overseers, Sambo and Quimbo–good or evil, they all live.

As for Tom himself, we all know what an ""Uncle Tom"" is, except we don’t. The popular Uncle Tom sucks up to the master and exhibits bovine patience. the real Uncle Tom is both a realist and a man of deep principle. When he is sold by Mr. Shelby in Kentucky, he knows enough of Shelby’s affairs to know that what his master asserts is true: it’s Tom who must go or the whole estate will be sold off for debt, including Tom’s wife and three children. Later, on the Legree estate, his religious faith tells him that the greatest danger he finds there is not to his life but to his soul. His logic is impeccable. He holds fast to his soul, in the face of suffering, in a way that even nonbelievers like myself must respect. In fact, Tom’s story eerily prefigures stories of spiritual solace through deep religious belief that have come out of both the Soviet Gulag and the Nazi concentration camp in the same way that the structure of power on Legree’s plantation, and the suffering endured there, forecasts and duplicates many stories of recent genocides.

The power of Uncle Tom’s Cabin is the power of brilliant analysis married to great wisdom of feeling. Stowe never forgets the logical end of any relationship in which one person is the subject and the other is the object. No matter how the two people feel, or what their intentions are, the logic of the relationship is inherently tragic and traps both parties until the false subject/object relationship is ended. Stowe’s most oft-repeated and potent representation of this inexorable logic is the forcible separation of family members, especially of mothers from children. Eliza, faced with the sale of her child, Harry, escapes across the breaking ice of the Ohio River. Lucy, whose ten-month-old is sold behind her back, kills herself. Prue, who has been used for breeding, must listen to her last child cry itself to death because her mistress won’t let her save it; she falls into alcoholism and thievery and is finally whipped to death. Cassy, prefiguring a choice made by one of the characters in Toni Morrison’s Beloved, kills her last child so that it won’t grow up in slavery. All of these women have been promised something by their owners–love, education, the privilege and joy of raising their children–but, owing to slavery, all of these promises have been broken. The grief and despair these women display is no doubt what T. S. Eliot was thinking of when he superciliously labeled Uncle Tom’s Cabin ""sensationalist propaganda,"" but, in fact, few critics in the nineteenth century ever accused Stowe of making up or even exaggerating such stories. One group of former slaves who were asked to comment on Stowe’s depiction of slave life said that she had failed to portray the very worst, and Stowe herself was afraid that if she told some of what she had heard from escaped slaves and other informants during her eighteen years in Cincinnati, the book would be too dark to find any readership at all.

Stowe’s analysis does not stop with the slave owners and traders, or with the slaves themselves. She understands perfectly that slavery is an economic system embedded in America as a whole, and she comments ironically on Christian bankers in New York whose financial dealings result in the sale of slaves, on Northern politicians who promote the capture of escaped slaves for the sake of the public good, on ministers of churches who give the system a Christian stamp of approval. One of Stowe’s most skillful techniques is her method of weaving a discussion of slavery into the dialogue of her characters. Especially interesting is a conversation Mark Twain could have paid attention to. Augustine St. Clare and his abolitionist cousin, Ophelia, are discussing his failure to act in accordance with his feelings of revulsion against slavery. After entertaining Ophelia’s criticisms for a period, Augustine points out that Ophelia herself is personally disgusted by black people and doesn’t like to come into contact with them. He says, ""You would think no harm in a child’s caressing a large dog, even if he was black . . . custom with us does what Christianity ought to do,–obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice."" When Ophelia takes over the education of Topsy, a child who has suffered a most brutal previous upbringing, she discovers that she can do nothing with her until she takes her, literally, to her bosom. But personal relationships do not mitigate the evils of slavery; Ophelia makes sure to give Topsy her freedom.

Stowe also understands that the real root of slavery is that it is profitable as well as customary. Augustine and his brother live with slavery because it is the system they know and because they haven’t the imagination to live without it. Simon Legree embraces slavery because he can make money from it and because it gives him even more absolute power over his workers than he could find in the North or in England.

The very heart of nineteenth-century American experience and literature, the nature and meaning of slavery, is finally what Twain cannot face in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. As Jim and Huck drift down Twain’s beloved river, the author finds himself nearing what must have been a crucial personal nexus: how to reconcile the felt memory of boyhood with the cruel implications of the social system within which that boyhood was lived. He had avoided this problem for the most part in Tom Sawyer: slaves hardly impinge on the lives of Tom and the other boys. But once Twain allows Jim a voice, this voice must speak in counterpoint to Huck’s voice and must raise issues that cannot easily be resolved, either personally or culturally. Harriet Beecher Stowe, New Englander, daughter of Puritans and thinkers, active in the abolitionist movement and in the effort to aid and educate escaped slaves, had no such personal conflict when she sat down to write Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Nothing about slavery was attractive to her either as a New Englander or as a resident of Cincinnati for almost twenty years. Her lack of conflict is apparent in the clarity of both the style and substance of the novel.

Why, then, we may ask, did Uncle Tom’s Cabin, for all its power and popularity, fail to spawn American literature? Fail, even, to work as a model for how to draw passionate, autonomous, and interesting black literary characters? Fail to keep the focus of the American literary imagination on the central dilemma of the American experience: race? Part of the reason is certainly that the public conversation about race and slavery that had been a feature of antebellum American life fell silent after the Civil War. Perhaps the answer is to be found in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: everyone opted for the ultimate distraction, lighting out for the territory. And the reason is to be found in Uncle Tom’s Cabin: that’s where the money was.

But so what? These are only authors, after all, and once a book is published the author can’t be held accountable for its role in the culture. For that we have to blame the citizens themselves, or their teachers, or their teachers, the arbiters of critical taste. In ""Melodramas of Beset Manhood: How Theories of American Fiction Exclude Women Authors,"" the scholar Nina Baym has already detailed how the canonization of a very narrow range of white, Protestant, middle-class male authors (Twain, Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, etc.) has misrepresented our literary life–first by defining the only worthy American literary subject as ""the struggle of the individual against society [in which] the essential quality of America comes to reside in its unsettled wilderness and the opportunities that such a wilderness offers to the individual as the medium on which he may inscribe, unhindered, his own destiny and his own nature,"" and then by casting women, and especially women writers (specialists in the ""flagrantly bad best-seller,"" according to Leslie Fiedler), as the enemy. In such critical readings, all other themes and modes of literary expression fall out of consideration as ""un-American."" There goes Uncle Tom’s Cabin, there goes Edith Wharton, there goes domestic life as a subject, there go almost all the best-selling novelists of the nineteenth century and their readers, who were mostly women. The real loss, though, is not to our literature but to our culture and ourselves, because we have lost the subject of how the various social groups who may not escape to the wilderness are to get along in society; and, in the case of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the hard-nosed, unsentimental dialogue about race that we should have been having since before the Civil War. Obviously, Uncle Tom’s Cabin is no more the last word on race relations than The Brothers Karamazov or David Copperfield is on any number of characteristically Russian or English themes and social questions. Some of Stowe’s ideas about inherent racial characteristics (whites: cold, heartless; blacks: naturally religious and warm) are bad and have been exploded. One of her solutions to the American racial conflicts that she foresaw, a colony in Africa, she later repudiated. Nevertheless, her views about many issues were brilliant, and her heart was wise. She gained the respect and friendship of many men and women of goodwill, black and white, such as Frederick Douglass, the civil-rights activist Mary Church Terrill, the writer and social activist James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. What she did was find a way to talk about slavery and family, power and law, life and death, good and evil, North and South. She truly believed that all Americans together had to find a solution to the problem of slavery in which all were implicated. When her voice, a courageously public voice–as demonstrated by the public arguments about slavery that race throughout Uncle Tom’s Cabin–fell silent in our culture and was replaced by the secretive voice of Huck Finn, who acknowledges Jim only when they are alone on the raft together out in the middle of the big river, racism fell out of the public world and into the private one, where whites think it really is but blacks know it really isn’t.

Should Huckleberry Finn be taught in the schools? The critics of the Propaganda Era laid the groundwork for the universal inclusion of the book in school curriculums by declaring it great. Although they predated the current generation of politicized English professors, this was clearly a political act, because the entry of Huck Finn into classrooms sets the terms of the discussion of racism and American history, and sets them very low: all you have to do to be a hero is acknowledge that your poor sidekick is human; you don’t actually have to act in the interests of his humanity. Arguments about censorship have been regularly turned into nonsense by appeals to Huck’s ""greatness."" Moreover, so much critical thinking has gone into defending Huck so that he can be great, so that American literature can be found different from and maybe better than Russian or English or French literature, that the very integrity of the critical enterprise has been called into question. That most readers intuitively reject the last twelve chapters of the novel on the grounds of tedium or triviality is clear from the fact that so many critics have turned themselves inside out to defend them. Is it so mysterious that criticism has failed in our time after being so robust only a generation ago? Those who cannot be persuaded that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great novel have to draw some conclusion.

I would rather my children read Uncle Tom’s Cabin, even though it is far more vivid in its depiction of cruelty than Huck Finn, and this is because Stowe’s novel is clearly and unmistakably a tragedy. No whitewash, no secrets, but evil, suffering, imagination, endurance, and redemption–just like life. Like little Eva, who eagerly but fearfully listens to the stories of the slaves that her family tries to keep from her, our children want to know what is going on, what has gone on, and what we intend to do about it. If ""great"" literature has any purpose, it is to help us face up to our responsibilities instead of enabling us to avoid them once again by lighting out for the territory."

Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein (Protein)
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now flex (Now flex)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
Chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly)
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly

Tell my mama I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick

734,Lose You,Drake,"[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Outro: 600 Breezy]
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?

736,Good Guy,Eminem Featuring Jessie Reyez,"[Verse: Eminem]
İşte tekrar kahramanlardan döndük kötü adamlara
Eskiden Romeo'ndum, bir kaç kez de terkettik birbirimizi
Yüzleşmemiz gereken kötü durumlar oluşmuştu
Ama bu birlikte bunları aşabileceğimiz umudunu verdi bana
Kesik bir kulak memesini sana zarf içinde göndersem iyi olabilir
Fakat sen ne kadar zorlardın sınırları benim için?
Aynı Vincent van Gogh'un yaptığı gibi yapmak, sırf bir kaltağı ikna etmek için
Düpedüz yalan söyleyen bir ev hanımı olmak
Kör kütük sarhoş, şimdi benden tam ters istikamette uzaklaşıyor
Dışarı çıktım, neden bu kadar kötü davranıyor
Kız benim boylarımda, ağzıma iki tane vuruyor
Beyler, uğruna öleceğiniz biri
Kalbinize bir hançer saplasa, daha fazla çabalar mısınız?
Başka bir gece yarısı, kapımın önünde yalpaladı
Günışığı girsin içeri ve bizim tüm yaptığımız daha fazla kavga etmek
Ve ben şiddet uygulamıyorum, ama o çekmeceme doğru gidiyor
İçine K-Y yerleştirmek için
St. Ides gibi kokan ve büyük ihtimalle beş erkekle daha sikişen
Sekiz dokuz erkeğe sakso çeken bir kaltak tarafından suçlanıyorum
Baltamı alıp çerçevelerimize doğru gidiyorum
Kaltak evet çerçeveden yok ettiğim sensin, ben kazandım
Yeni bir yüksek skor elde ediyorum, içinde olduğum bu oyunda benle yarış
Arkadaşlarımla buluşacağın zaman bağırsakların hareket ettiğinde
Götünü silmen için sana 2 katlı bir peçete bırakıyorum
Yeminimizi tekrarladığımızda elde ettiğim şey bu mu olacaktı?
Şunu söyleyeceğin günü bekliyorum
""Marshall, ben ne kadar da kaltakmışım, ve işte yeni bir çocuk, sen onun yerine geçeceksin.""
Yumurtalıklarını bağlattın onun için, memelerine silikon yaptırdın onun için
Beni derinden yaralıyor, ama senden sonra yaşadığım bu acı
Yemin ederim ki gri gökyüzünü bitireceğim
Işık hüzmeleri geliyor rüzgar gibi, ödeme zammı alacaksın
Ben iyi adam mıyım yoksa sadece öyleymiş gibi mi davranıyorum?
Ve o erkeğin kıçına tekmeyi basacağına dair olan umudum?
Hayalimin gerçekleşmesi olur, sana ""Siktir git!"" diye bağırabilirim
Zar atarken yaptığın gibi bir hayata son veriyorsun sanırım
Çünkü sen bana bakıyorsun ve o ufak yılanları gözlerinde yuvarlıyorsun

[Chorus/Outro: Jessie Reyez]
Jüriyi avucuna aldığından beri, bana suçlusun diyorlar
Bana suçlusun diyorlar
Jüriyi avucuna aldığından beri, bana suçlusun diyorlar
Gerçek beni bildiğin halde bile
Aldatan olamazsın, inançsızı bile inandırırsın
Ve ben hislerimde değilim, ben yokum
Ama sana iyi bir adam olduğunu söyleyeyim
Çünkü aşk böyle bir şeye benzemiyor
Aldatan olamazsın, inançsızı bile inandırırsın
Ve ben hislerimde değilim, ben yokum
Ama sana iyi bir adam olduğunu söyleyeyim
Onlar ""Sen iyi adamsın."" diyor
Onlar, onlar, onlar, ""Sen iyi adamsın."" diyor"

Slick my hair back like I'm Chico DeBarge (Ay)

All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

Is at the top of the list of the things I want

I'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh
Got racks all inside the safe
If I run out of space, stay booked out of state

[Verse 4: Young Thug & Gunna]
Top off the Benz, the one with no space
It's drivin' itself, hit the gas and the brakes
I had her bent inside of the Wraith
Besides the tint, the curtain in the way
I had to sprint all way to the end
I lost some old friends, couldn't keep up the pace
Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face
The jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith
I'm dodging the rain and I'm dodging the hate
I don't need a pass 'cause I'm not in school
You playin', you gon' be another cold case
My diamonds gon' dance, they come and enhance
My dick in her hand, I bet it get ate
I spent sixty bands on one of my cases
The paperwork in, my co-D is safe
YSL, we the guys
We murder him and his tribe
I show you around like I Spy
This city is mine 'til I die, ah
Patek the rock, ah
Soon up, we shoot at your spot, ah
Perfectly aim for the top, ah
Fuckin' your ho 'til she tired, yeah
Yeah, just look at these rocks, uh
Lil' mama got top, it's wet as a mop, whoa
I creep in the spot
It's knock knock zoom, he on the way out
Got too many vibes
She feelin' my brother, we swiggity-swap (Thugger)
Keep sendin' him Dots
I'm gon' free my cousin, I won't let him rot
You sent me a dyke
I fucked her so good, I got her back right
It's locked, and she got shark jaws
But I never want the key to the heart, nah
She say my music art
And love it when I'm rappin' with a guitar
We really came from the A
My shit flowin', havin' plenty of bars

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake
Me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake
We done made a few M's and I'm straight
Got me a mil', it fit my plate
Shit, the teeth on plastic plate
Just 'cause I listen don't mean I debate, uh
I don't got no time to be late
I done missed a few mils, got some buried in the lake
Hey, constantly dodging the grave
The world is a cage, the Planet of Apes (Planet)
Gotta keep the family straight
We know what it takes, the slimiest snakes, uh
I done ran up a whole mil'
I'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh
Got racks all inside the safe
If I run out of space, stay booked out of state

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to

[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Outro]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, make good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen
(You know you came from it and some day you'll return to it)"
753,All Of Me,John Legend,"[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh"
754,Change My Mind,Meghan Linsey,"[Verse 1]
Was it all just pretend back then when
You said you loved me for me?
Cause lately it seems the girl of your dreams
Is someone that I can't be
Oh but I try
And oh I cry

[Chorus]
You want me to change
See things your way
It's easy to see, I'm losing me
One little piece at a time
Oh baby I've tried
But this is my life
Boy you want me to change
Baby I'll change, my mind

[Verse 2]
Well I used to believe you knew better than me
But now I'm the one in control
And I might make mistakes but I'll make 'em my way
I won't pay with a piece of my soul
You made it clear
I had to decide

[Chorus]
You want me to change
See things your way
It's easy to see, I'm losing me
One little piece at a time
Oh baby I've tried
But this is my life
Boy you want me to change
Baby I'll change, my mind"
755,Found / Tonight,Lin-Manuel Miranda & Ben Platt,"[Verse 1: Ben Platt]
We may not yet have reached our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell their story
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Tonight

[Verse 2: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?

[Verse 3: Ben Platt, Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
All we see is light
'Cause maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
For forever
'Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

[Verse 4: Ben Platt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Both]
And oh
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
Oh
No matter what they tell you
Someone will come running
To take you home
Raise a glass to all of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
They'll tell the story of tonight
And all is new
All is new
All is new
It's only a matter of time

[Verse 5: Both]
Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you're broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found

[Verse 6: Ben Platt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Both]
And when our children tell their story
You will be found
They'll tell the story of tonight
Whoa
No matter what they tell you
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
The story of tonight"

757,Live From The Gutter,Drake & Future,"[Intro: Future]
Hendrix, yeah
I woke up like this

[Hook: Future]
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking about some big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money, bitch

[Verse 1: Future]
Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry, I'm a savage
I've seen the stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar

[Hook: Future]
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' about some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch

[Verse 2: Drake]
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion, woo
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gonna end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what’s coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gon' miss you
They don’t want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm...

Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking about some big money shit
Reporting live from the damn gutter

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

[Verse 2: Drake]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe

Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

[Verse 4: Drake]
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something

You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer

Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, faster and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same

It feels like summer

Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I know
Oh, I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world would change
But it seems like the same

I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change

Yessir

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)

They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, ""How it's goin'""
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, ""I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'""
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cause

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, ""Fuck a friend""
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Cause I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time

The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin

In there right next to that carbine

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'

What's good? That sound familiar, never been here befo'
Life good, 'cause I just got quoted two hundred a show
Oh no, oh no, two hundred a show
Overnight, all this money that I've been makin', I gave it right back
To all of the people that made me, you know we like that
Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it
And then we do the show and they recite that
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happen–happen–happen

[Chorus]
Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' (Woo, woo)

[Bridge 1]
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now they know the name
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
All they ever do is hate the boy, but now I run the game
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate now all you want, but shit won't ever be the same
Tell me how you really feel, how you really feel
You can hate me, but I'm not the reason that your life is lame

[Verse 2]
Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to be a good person?
Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard, to stop acting like a bitch? (Woo!)
I treated everybody with respect and now I'm rich (Woo!)
I treated everybody with respect
Maybe you got issues with your daddy, doe
Maybe you was bullied back in high school
Maybe you are just a tool

[Bridge 2]
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
The reason I don't fuck with nobody, and
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
The reason I came up with nobody, and
Maybe you're the reason, you're the reason
Everybody think this right here happened

[Chorus]
Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trap over–over–overnight
People think this how this shit happened, but they never right
Acting like they got it, they got it, but they never quite seem to understand that this right here deeper than all that
Hustlin' the streets like they trappin' and burnin' down, shit"

Only I can mention me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, ""Don't text me, ho""
Told you four times, ""Don't test me, ho""
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me

Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them

Don't now, don't stop it

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you"

She's a good girl, she's Daddy's favourite
He's saved for Harvard, he knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, I think she's fluent

[Pre-Chorus: Calum & Michael]
'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that’s what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught them

[Chorus: All & Luke]
She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught

[Verse 2: Calum & Michael]
She's a good girl, a straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say, ""That's where you'll find me""

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Michael]
But if you look then you won’t find her there
She may be clever but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She’ll be with her boyfriend
She’s not reading books

She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven’t been caught
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls

Enrique Iglesias, Mickael Carreira, Gente De Zona & Desmecer Bueno

Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón
(Aceleras o meu coração)
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando (bailando)
Bailando (bailando)
A noite aquecendo, teu corpo mexendo
Subindo e baixando (subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (bailando)
Bailando (bailando)
Este fogo cá dentro subindo crescendo
Ardendo e queimando

Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (não aguento mais)
Ya no puedo más (não aguento mais)
Com essa melodia, és a minha fantasia
Com a tua filosofia a minha mente está vazia
Não aguento mais (ya no puedo más)
Não aguento mais (ya no puedo más)

Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo
Bailar contigo, tener contigo
Una noche loca (una noche loca)
Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca)
Eu quero estar contigo, viver contigo
Dançar contigo e ter contigo
Uma noite louca (uma noite louca)
Uma noite louca

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Tú me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión
(Entro noutra dimensão)
Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón
(Teu suspiro acelera o meu coração)
Que ironia do destino não poder tocar-te
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor

Bailando (bailando)

A noite aquecendo, teu corpo mexendo
Subindo e baixando (subiendo y bajando)

778,She Don't Love You,Eric Paslay,"She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

She don't love you
She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
I remember her in the sunlight
I remember her when she was mine, mine"

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 1]
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

[Verse 2]
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

[Bridge]
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

[Chorus]
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you, it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out"

Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (greaze!)

Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me (yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy

Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (greaze!)

Baby hit my line because she see them stars in the roof
I'm up, now the whole gang got 24's on the coupes
Ta-ta-take a L, me, never, we in love, I lied
Foreign's what we ride, in the jet, we fly
If he sayin' he respect me, then it's likewise
Another man safe from another drive-by
I like the way she shake that cake, it's like a race
If she bad, I might take her out, not on a date
Say she boujee, she hit my phone, 'cause her nigga late
A 100K just off two shows spent that in a day

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
These brand new, don't step on my Balenci's
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that

Baby let's just take our chance

Let me get up in this bitch, like, ""What's good, ho?""
Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life
I been grindin' on a fight, I been writin' on a flight
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood
Better act good or get smacked good
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna get right
Anybody got advice?
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody got a vice
I leave 'em diminished
And I do not know if you know
That I am so ahead of my time
That my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished
The greatest alive, bitch, I been it
Now go on your business, can I get a witness?
Been smoking and drinking a little bit
There's levels to the litness

Pull up with that new-new in the driveway
So fresh, I double park that bitch sideways
When it comes to life, I do it my way
Smoked out 180 on the highway
Yeah, I'm sitting shotgun
Gotta let my shawty drive

I got millions in the bank because my dream's strong
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on
But I get my green on, yes, I get my green on
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O

About to blow, about to show
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em

And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Bridge]
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile (And I can't fake)
I can't fake like I'm alright (Another smile)
Woo, ah (Woo, ah) (Ooh)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine (I'm feeling fine)
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile (Yeah)"
793,I Guess I Just Feel Like,John Mayer,"[Verse 1]
I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

[Outro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah"
794,Changed It,Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I did it for everybody out here on their own
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages
And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they on the same shit
Oh my god, I changed it
Oh my god, they still on the same shit
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
The big 3 on the court, bitch at them bleachers
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread dissin' Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin' pills, but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switched flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and the bitch is my son
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run
MJ, game 6, (you my) Jackson, Tyson

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
No more CMB shit, I changed it
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game
And y'all chump change
I'm just sayin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Quiet dawg, my phone changed up
I'm icin' out my Barbie chains up
And when I come, get your change cup
These bum bitches never change up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they on the same
Oh my god, I changed
Oh my god, they still on the same
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me

That your boyfriend? That shit disgusts me"

Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka

I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, ""Boy I think the money startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness

798,Real Friends,Kanye West,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him"
